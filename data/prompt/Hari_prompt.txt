Extract SDRF-Proteomics metadata entities from scientific manuscripts.

TASK: Identify and extract metadata entities using exact text spans from the manuscript.

ANNOTATION SCOPE:
- Extract ONLY from: Title, Abstract, Methods/Materials sections
- Methods sections include any text with keywords: "digested", "mass spectrometry", "sample preparation", "enrichment", "LC-MS", "proteomics", "peptide", "protein extraction"
- IGNORE: Introduction, Results, Discussion, References, Figure captions, Tables

EXTRACTION PROCESS (TWO-ROUND VERIFICATION):

ROUND 1 - Liberal Extraction:
1. Read through the ENTIRE manuscript systematically
2. Extract ALL potential SDRF entities from target sections (be liberal - include anything that might be relevant)
3. Assign preliminary labels to each potential entity
4. Include complete phrases as they appear in text
5. Don't worry about duplicates or uncertain matches at this stage
6. Create comprehensive initial list

ROUND 2 - Strict Review & Filtering:
1. Re-examine each Round 1 extraction critically
2. Remove any uncertain or ambiguous matches
3. Verify each label assignment is correct and specific
4. Fix any incorrect label assignments
5. Remove duplicates (same label + same text span)
6. Ensure every extraction uses exact text from manuscript
7. Remove any extractions that don't clearly match SDRF categories
8. Keep only high-confidence extractions

FINAL OUTPUT:
- Output only the high-confidence extractions that survived Round 2 filtering
- Every line must follow format: "Label: ExactTextSpan"
- No duplicates, no uncertain matches, no formatting errors

FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
Before submitting, verify:
- Every line has format 'Label: Text'
- All labels are from the valid SDRF list
- No duplicate extractions exist
- All text spans are exactly as written in manuscript
- Only high-confidence matches are included

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Extract ONLY exact phrases as they appear in text - NO paraphrasing, inference, or interpretation
2. Preserve original capitalization, punctuation, and spacing exactly
3. Include complete spans as written (e.g., if text says "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos", extract the full phrase)
4. EVERY extraction must have a valid SDRF label - no unlabeled text
5. Use most specific applicable label from the provided list
6. Do NOT add context, explanations, or interpretations
7. Do NOT infer missing information or fill gaps
8. If exact text doesn't clearly match a label, skip it entirely


LABEL-SPECIFIC CLARIFICATIONS:

Instrument: Only annotate when the text includes the exact name or model of the mass spectrometer (e.g., "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos", "Q Exactive HF", "TripleTOF 5600").

❌ Do NOT label general phrases like “mass spectrometry-based approach”, “MS analysis”, or “mass spectrometry” as Instrument.

✅ These general phrases may be valid under AssayName if they describe the experimental strategy.
CRITICAL: Extract text EXACTLY as written. Do not:
- Normalize terminology (e.g., 'LC-MS/MS' stays 'LC-MS/MS', not 'liquid chromatography')
- Correct spelling or grammar
- Add missing articles or prepositions
- Combine separate mentions into one
- Make any textual modifications whatsoever

EXAMPLES:
✓ GOOD:
- Text: "C57BL/6 mice" → Extract: Organism: C57BL/6 mice
- Text: "liver tissue samples" → Extract: OrganismPart: liver tissue samples
- Text: "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer" → Extract: Instrument: Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer

✗ NEVER DO:
- Change text: "C57BL/6 mice" → "mouse" (NO normalization)
- Add context: "liver" → "liver tissue" (NO inference)
- Interpret: "MS analysis" → "mass spectrometry analysis" (NO expansion)
- Extract without labels: "phosphoproteins" (MUST be "Label: phosphoproteins")
- Repeat duplicates: Extract "Compound 2" 20 times (extract once per unique span)
- Skip sections: Read the entire target text, not just the beginning

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Every extracted entity MUST follow this exact format:
Label: ExactTextSpan

REQUIRED FORMAT RULES:
- Each line must start with a valid SDRF label followed by a colon
- NO lines without labels
- NO bare text without corresponding labels
- Report each unique text span only once (no repetitions)
- If you cannot assign a confident label to text, do not extract it

DUPLICATE HANDLING:
- Extract each unique phrase only ONCE per label type
- If "Compound 2" appears 10 times, report it only once as "AssayName: Compound 2"
- Scan the ENTIRE text systematically - do not stop after finding a few entities
