ABSTRACT:
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex meshwork of insoluble fibrillar proteins and signaling factors interacting together to provide architectural and instructional cues to the surrounding cells. Alterations in ECM organization or composition and excessive ECM deposition have been observed in diseases such as fibrosis, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. We provide here optimized protocols to solubilize ECM proteins from normal or tumor tissues, digest the proteins into peptides, analyze ECM peptides by mass spectrometry, and interpret the mass spectrometric data. In addition, we present here two novel R-script-based web tools allowing rapid annotation and relative quantification of ECM proteins, peptides, and intensity/abundance in mass spectrometric data output files. We illustrate this protocol with ECMs obtained from two pairs of tissues, which differ in ECM content and cellularity: triple-negative breast cancer and adjacent mammary tissue, and omental metastasis from high-grade serous ovarian cancer and normal omentum. The complete proteomics data set generated in this study has been deposited to the public repository ProteomeXchange with the data set identifier: PXD005554.

■ MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples
Patient samples were kindly donated by women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC; n = 2) or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; n = 2) undergoing surgery at Barts Health NHS Trust between 2010 and 2014. Tissues deemed by a pathologist to be surplus to diagnostic and therapeutic requirements were collected together with associated clinical data under the terms of the Barts Gynae Tissue Bank (HTA license number 12199. REC no: 10/H0304/14) and Barts Breast Cancer Tissue Bank (HTA license number 12199. REC no: 15/EE/0192). In both cases TNBC and HGSOC samples are described as containing tumor cells and desmoplasia, while normal or adjacent samples are described as having no obvious tumor cell infiltration or desmoplasia (Supplementary Table S1A). Masson’s trichrome staining was performed according to standard procedures to evaluate the ECM content and cellularity of all four tissue types.
Enrichment for ECM Components
ECM proteins were enriched from frozen whole tissue or tumor sections (20 × 30 μm sections, ∼40−50 mg of tissue), as previously described. In brief, tissue sections were resuspended in the cytosolic (“C”) buffer of the CNMCS compartmental protein extraction kit (Millipore) and disrupted by vortexing. The samples were then incubated in a series of buffers to remove sequentially nuclear proteins (buffer “N”), membrane proteins (buffer “M”), and cytoskeletal proteins (buffer “CS”) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and our previous protocol. The remaining insoluble pellet is enriched for ECM proteins. Note that the subsequent steps can also be conducted on ECM-enriched samples prepared according to other methods.−
ECM Protein Solubilization
ECM-enriched samples were solubilized in 8 M urea, 20 mM HEPES containing Na3VO4 (100 mM), NaF (0.5M), β-glycerol phosphate (1 M), and Na2H2P2O7 (0.25 M). Samples were vortexed for 30 s and held on ice prior to sonication at 50% intensity, 3 times for 15 s, on ice. These resuspended and partially solubilized ECM-enriched samples were either directly digested into peptides as described below (“crude” ECM samples) or were centrifuged at 20 000g for 10 min at 5 °C, and the supernatant was recovered to protein low-bind tubes. This fraction will further be referred to as the urea-soluble fraction. Protein concentration of the urea-soluble fraction was estimated using BCA assay, and 80 μg of protein was digested into peptides as described below. The postcentrifugation urea-insoluble pellet was resuspended in 2 M urea, and proteins were digested as described below.
ECM Protein Digestion into Peptides
Disulfide bonds were reduced by adding 5 mM dithiothreitol to the samples for a 1 h incubation under agitation at room temperature. Free cysteines were alkylated by adding iodoacetamide at a final concentration of 8.3 mM to the samples for a 1 h incubation under agitation at room temperature in the dark. After diluting to 2 M urea, 20 mM HEPES, samples were deglycosylated with 1500 units of PNGaseF (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h under agitation. Samples were pre-digested with 1.6 μg of Lys-C (Pierce) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h under agitation and digested with bead-immobilized trypsin (40 μL of beads per 250 μg of protein; Pierce) for 16 h at 37 °C under agitation. Samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 1% v/v), centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min at 5 °C. Supernatants were transferred to clean microcentrifuge tubes on ice. Glygen TopTips were equilibrated with 100% LC−MS-grade acetonitrile (ACN) and then washed with 99% H2O (+1% ACN, 0.1% TFA) prior to loading the peptide samples. Samples were washed with 99% H2O (+1% ACN, 0.1% TFA), and desalted peptides were eluted with 70/30 ACN/H2O + 0.1% TFA. Desalted peptides were dried and stored at −20 °C.
Liquid Chromatography−Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC−MS/MS)
Equal volumes of each sample, corresponding to ∼100 ng of material, were initially analyzed via LC−MS/MS, and the total numbers of peptides identified and the sum of the intensities of the precursor ions were used as a normalization metric to determine equivalent peptide amounts. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC using an EASY-nLC1000 (Thermo Scientific) using a pre-column (made in house, 6 cm of 10 μm C18) and a self-pack 5 μm tip analytical column (12 cm of 5 μm C18, New Objective) over a 140 min gradient before nanoelectrospray using a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B was 80% MeCN/0.1% formic acid. The gradient conditions were 0−10% B (0−5 min), 10−30% B (5−105 min), 30−40% B (105−119 min), 40−60% B (119−124 min), 60−100% B (124−126 min), 100% B (126−136 min), 100−0% B (136−138 min), and 0% B (138−140 min). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode. The parameters for the full MS scan were: resolution of 70 000 across 350−2000 m/z, AGC 3e, and maximum IT 50 ms. The full MS scan was followed by MS/MS for the top 10 precursor ions in each cycle with a normal collision energy of 28 and dynamic exclusion of 30 s.
Off-Line Fractionation of Peptides by Reversed-Phase Chromatography at High pH
Equivalent peptide amounts were fractionated via high-pH reversed-phase HPLC. Peptides were resuspended in 50 uL of buffer A (10 mM NH4HCO3, pH8) and separated on a 4.6 mm × 250 mm 300Extend-C18, 5 μm column (Agilent) using an 80 min gradient from 1% to 100% buffer B (90% MeCN, 10 mM NH4HCO3, pH8) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Fractions were collected over 75 min at 1 min intervals beginning at 5 min after the start of the gradient. The fractions were concatenated into 15 fractions non-contiguously (1 + 16 + 31 + 46 + 61, 2 + 17 + 32 + 47 + 62, etc.). The fractions were brought to near dryness in a speed-vac (Thermo Scientific). Each fraction was resuspended in 80 μL of 0.1% formic acid, and 4 μL was analyzed via LC−MS/MS, as described above using the same 140 min gradient.
Protein Identification
Raw mass spectral data files (.raw) were searched using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific) and Mascot version 2.4.1 (Matrix Science) using the SwissProt Homo sapiens database containing 20 199 entries. Mascot search parameters were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 15 mmu for fragment-ion mass tolerance; two missed cleavages of trypsin; fixed modification was carbamidomethylation of cysteine; and variable modifications were oxidized methionine, deamidation of asparagine, pyro-glutamic acid modification at N-terminal glutamine, and hydroxylation of lysine and proline (see Results section). Only peptides with a Mascot score ≥25 and an isolation interference ≤30 were included in the data analysis. The average false discovery rate was 0.0074 (ranging from 0.0032 to 0.0144). For each protein, total precursor ion intensity (further referred to as “peptide intensity”) was calculated as the sum of MS1-precursor-ion-peak areas for all identified peptides of the given protein. Confidently identified proteins were further annotated as being part of the extracellular matrix as previously defined and using the novel tool Matrisome Annotator presented in this publication (see Results section).
