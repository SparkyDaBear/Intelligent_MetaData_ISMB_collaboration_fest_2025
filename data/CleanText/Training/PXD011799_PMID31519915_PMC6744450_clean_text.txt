ABSTRACT:
Tumor associated inflammation predicts response to immune checkpoint blockade in human melanoma. Current theories on regulation of inflammation center on anti-tumor T cell responses. Here we show that tumor associated B cells are vital to melanoma associated inflammation. Human B cells express pro- and anti-inflammatory factors and differentiate into plasmablast-like cells when exposed to autologous melanoma secretomes in vitro. This plasmablast-like phenotype can be reconciled in human melanomas where plasmablast-like cells also express T cell-recruiting chemokines CCL3, CCL4, CCL5. Depletion of B cells in melanoma patients by anti-CD20 immunotherapy decreases tumor associated inflammation and CD8+ T cell numbers. Plasmablast-like cells also increase PD-1+ T cell activation through anti-PD-1 blockade in vitro and their frequency in pretherapy melanomas predicts response and survival to immune checkpoint blockade. Tumor associated B cells therefore orchestrate and sustain melanoma inflammation and may represent a predictor for survival and response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.
The regulation of tumor inflammation is incompletely understood and the role of B cells is unclear. Here, the authors show that a specific subtype of B cells is induced in melanoma and required to recruit T lymphocytes and elicit inflammation.

Patient-derived material
Samples of both trials were collected under local ethics committee-approved protocols (ethical review board of the Medical University of Vienna, votes 457–2007, 969–2010) after obtaining informed patient consent. Separate ethics committee-approval was obtained to make the derived proteomics and RNA-seq data publicly available (ethical review board of the Medical University of Vienna, vote 1555–2016).
Ten patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab in a therapeutic setting (Clinical trials number ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01376713). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients as well as response data are given in ref. , additional clinical data are shown in Supplementary Data 1). Patients had to have adequate biopsy material for (i) multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and/or (ii) RNA-seq analysis from time points before initiation of therapy (week 0) and/or under anti-CD20 therapy (week 9 ± 2, with additional later samples as indicated for some patients), when immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed a consistent loss of CD19+ B lymphocytes (week 2 and later). From nine patients, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsies could be subjected to multiplex IHC, RNA-seq data were successfully generated from matched samples of four patients. We also collected pre-therapy PBMC samples for generation of EBV-immortalized peripheral B cells as well as adequate pre-therapy tumor biopsy material for generation of (i) early passage melanoma cells and (ii) autologous EBV-immortalized TAB from tumor single-cell suspensions. From four patients, all these samples were successfully established, from a further patient EBV-immortalized peripheral B cells as well as EBV-immortalized TAB could be established. To increase the number of patients with pre-therapy early passage melanoma cells and autologous EBV-immortalized peripheral B cells and TAB, we included one further patient who was considered for but did not undergo anti-CD20 therapy.
In addition, of two patients with metastatic melanoma who were treated with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in an adjuvant setting (EudraCT number: 2007-005125-30), adequate tumor biopsy material for RNA-seq was available at two time points: before initiation of anti-CD20 therapy, when the tumor mass was completely resected, and after disease progression under therapy. Both studies were investigator-initiated clinical pilot trials. Anti-CD20 antibodies (ofatumumab vs. rituximab) were chosen based on availability. Clinical details are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.
Induction experiments with MCM
Immediately after surgical resection, melanoma cells and TAB were collected by mechanical and enzymatic dissociation of metastatic melanoma tissue into single cells (tumor dissociation kit, gentleMACS Dissociator, both Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) as described earlier by us. Peripheral blood samples were collected in BD Vacutainer CPT cell preparation tubes and PBMC prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Melanoma cells grown from these single-cell suspensions were frozen after passage 2 and stored in liquid nitrogen. Cell purity was determined by flow cytometric staining for melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP) on a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The percentage of MCSP-positive cells was >97%. Sorting of TAB from single-cell suspensions and peripheral B cells from PBMC was performed with Dynabeads CD19 Pan B (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) as described. After detachment of beads and antibodies (DETACHaBEAD CD19 Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), flow cytometric analyses with a (PE)-conjugated CD19 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) revealed a purity of collected B cell samples between 89.3% and 98.4%, respectively. Immortalization of TAB and peripheral B cells with EBV was performed on autologous irradiated (2 × 30 Gy) PBMC as feeder cells essentially as described. The purity of immortalized B cells was assessed as >96% in all samples by flow cytometry. A semi-quantitative comparative proteome of autologous freshly isolated vs. immortalized TAB has revealed significant differences predominantly in pathways related to cell cycle proliferation, apoptosis, and interferon response. In addition, we have recently shown that immortalized TAB and peripheral blood-derived B cells can nicely recapitulate the induction of pro-tumorigenic/pro-inflammatory factors/cytokines in freshly isolated TAB and peripheral-blood-derived B cells upon exposure to soluble factors from human melanoma cells and, thus, can offer a consistent source of quality cells for such experiments.
To produce MCM, early passage (p3) human melanoma cells were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU penicillin G, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. At 80% confluence, the entire medium was replaced with fresh medium. MCM was collected 48 h thereafter and sterile filtrated. Control medium was prepared the same way, but without melanoma cells. For induction experiments, 5 × 105 human B cells were seeded in 24-well cell-culture plates (Corning Costar) and incubated in 1 ml MCM or control medium for 48 h. About 50% of the medium was substituted with fresh MCM after 24 h. B cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min at RT, snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C.
FACS analysis
Mock- or MCM-treated immortalized B cells or TAB were stained with the following antibodies or matched isotypes and analyzed on a FACS Aria III (BD): CD19 BV711 (clone SJ25C1, 0.06 µg/100 µl, catalog number 563036), CD20 AF700 (clone 2H7, 0.5 µg/100 µl, 560631), CD24 PE-CF594 (clone ML5, 1 µg/100 µl, 562405), CD27 BV421 (clone M-T271, 0.25 µg/100 µl, 562513), CD38 APC (clone HIT2, 0.125 µg/100 µl, 555462), CD138 PE (clone MI15, 0.125 µg/100 µl, 552026), IgD PE-Cy7 (clone IA6-2, 0.125 µg/100 µl, 561314), IgG FITC (clone G18-145, 0.125 µg/100 µl, 555786), IgM BV605 (clone G20-127, 0.5 µg/100 µl, 562977) (all BD biosciences). Live/dead cell exclusion was performed by addition of 7-AAD (5 µg/ml, Calbiochem) prior to acquisition of the samples. Data were analyzed using FlowJo 10.4.2 (FlowJo LLC). The gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 10.
Jurkat reporter assay
Jurkat E6.1 NF-kB::eGFP and Jurkat E6.1 NF-kB::eGFP-PD-1 reporter T cells have been previously described in detail. For functional assays, reporter cells (5 × 104/well) and mock treated or MCM-treated EBV immortalized B cells (2 × 104/well) were co-cultured in the presence of Staphylococcus enterotoxin E (SEE, Toxin technology, Inc. Sarasota, FL; used at final concentrations of 300 pg/ml and 1 ng/ml) for 24 h. The PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab (KeytrudaTM, MSD SHARP & DOHME GmbH) or an isotype control antibody (Ultra-LEAF human IgG4 isotype control, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) were added at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml. Following 24 h of co-culture, reporter gene expression was assessed as described in detail. Briefly, cells were harvested and stained using a CD19-APC antibody for exclusion of EBV immortalized B cells. Cells were analyzed using a FACS-CALIBUR flow cytometer and FlowJo software (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Geometric mean of fluorescence intensity (gMFI) of viable reporter cells was used for further analysis.
Cell viability assay, cell numbers
Cell viability was assayed along. Briefly, B cells were plated in 96-well plates in triplicates and cultured in control medium or MCM (see above) for 24–96 h. Cell viability was determined by cellular dehydrogenase activity using water soluble WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium), monosodium salt according to manufacturer’s instructions (Dojindo EU GmbH, Munich, Germany); 20 µl of WST-8 reagent were added to 200 µl of culture volume per well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The absorbance was determined using a microplate reader (Bender MedSystems GmbH, Vienna, Austria) at 450 nm with 620 nm as a reference wavelength.
Cell numbers were determined by counting B cells plated in 96-well plates at equal cell numbers in triplicates and cultured in control medium or MCM (see above) for 24–96 h. Cells were counted on a FACSCalibur (BD, San Diego, CA).
Proteomics analysis
All reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from SIGMA-Aldrich, unless specified otherwise. Cells were lysed in freshly prepared lysis buffer containing 100 mM Tris/HCL pH 7.6, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM NaF, protease inhibitor (cOmpleteTm EDTA-free), and phosphatase inhibitor (PhosSTOPTm) cocktail tablets (both Roche). Cell extraction and DNA sharing was assisted by sonication and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 20 °C. The supernatant was collected and the total protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology).
Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) was performed using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff filters (Millipore) essentially according to the procedure described by Wiśniewski et al.. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 M and the samples heated at 99 °C for 5 min; 200 µl of each protein extract was mixed with 3.8 ml of 8 M urea in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 (UA), in the filter unit and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C to remove SDS. Any remaining SDS was exchanged by urea in a second washing step with 4 ml of UA. Free thiols were alkylated with 2 ml of 50 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at RT. Afterward, three washes with 3 ml of UA solution and then three washes with 3 ml of 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) were performed. Proteins were digested on filters with trypsin (1:50; Trypsin Gold, Promega) in 50 mM TEAB overnight at 37 °C. Digested peptides were collected by centrifugation, acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and desalted using Sep-Pak C18 SPE cartridges (50 mg, Waters Corporation) using 80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA for the elution and evaporating the solvent in a vacuum centrifuge.
Isobaric labeling was performed using 10plex tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific); 200 µg peptide digest per cell line was resuspended in 100 mM TEAB buffer and labeled with 0.8 mg of TMT 10-plex™ reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, samples were quenched for 15 min with 8 µl 5% hydroxylamine at room temperature. Labeling efficiency was determined running aliquots of the samples on 1 h LC-MS/MS gradients and standard database searches with TMT-tags configured as variable modifications. Corresponding TMT-labeled samples were pooled, acidified with TFA to a final concentration of 1% TFA and concentrated via Sep-Pak C18 SPE cartridges (200 mg bed volume).
Off-line high-pH reversed phase fractionations was performed essentially according to ref.  with a few modifications. Peptides were separated on a Waters Xbridge BEH130 C18 3.5-µm 4.6 × 250 mm column on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 0.8 ml/min. Buffer A consisted of H2O and buffer B consisted of 90% acetonitrile (MeCN), both adjusted to pH 10 with ammonium hydroxide. The gradient was set as follows: 1% B to 30% B in 50 min, 45% B in 10 min, and 70% B in 5 min. Fractions were collected at minute intervals and reduced using a vacuum concentrator. Dried peptides were reconstituted in 2% MeCN, 0.1% TFA, and pooled to a total number of 12 fractions using a concatenation strategy covering the whole gradient. An aliquot of each fraction (5–10 µg) was used for analysis of the global proteome and residual samples were dried in a vacuum concentrator prior to TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment.
Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using a modified TiO2 batch protocol. In short, titanium dioxide beads (5 µm; GL Sciences, Japan) were sequentially washed with 120 µl of 50% methanol, 300 µl of ddH2O, and 2 × 300 µl binding solvent (1 M glycolic acid, 70% MeCN, 3% TFA). In between, beads were spun down and the supernatant was discarded.
Dried peptides of each of the 12 fractions were individually resuspended in 150 µl binding solvent and incubated with the titanium dioxide beads at a bead to peptide ratio of 1:4 for 30 min at RT under continuous rotation. Bead-bound peptides were washed twice with binding solvent, 2× with washing solvent A (70% MeCN, 3% TFA) and 2× with washing solvent B (1% MeCN, 0.1% TFA). Phosphopeptides were eluted from the beads with 2 × 150 µl 0.3 M NH4OH. The eluates were acidified by addition of TFA to a final concentration of 2% and desalted using C18 StageTips.
Global proteome and the phosphopeptide fractions were separated on an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano-flow chromatography system using a pre-column for sample loading (PepMapAcclaim C18, 2 cm × 0.1 mm, 5 μm,) and a C18 analytical column (PepMapAcclaim C18, 50 cm × 0.75 mm, 2 μm, all Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific), applying a linear gradient over for 2 h from 2 to 35% solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; solvent A 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 230 nl/min. Eluting peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer equipped with EASY-Spray™ source (all Thermo Fisher Scientific), operated in a data-dependent acquisition mode with a cycle time of 3 s. FTMS1 spectra were recorded at a resolution of 120k, with an automated gain control (AGC) target of 200,000, and a max injection time of 50 ms. Precursors were filtered according to charge state (included charge states 2–6 z), and monoistopic peak assignment. Selected precursors were excluded from repeated fragmentation using a dynamic window (40 s, ±10 ppm). The MS2 precursor were isolated with a quadrupole mass filter width of 1.2 m/z. For FTMS2, the Orbitrap was operated at 50k resolution, with an AGC target of 100,000 and a maximal injection time of 150 ms for global proteome samples and 250 ms for phosphopeptide samples. Precursors were fragmented by high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 42%.
Transcriptomics analysis
The amount of total RNA was quantified using the Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation system (Life Technologies) and the RNA integrity number (RIN) was determined using the Experion Automated Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad).
For the co-culture experiments, the isolated RNA (1 µg) was processed using the SENSE mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit V2 (Lexogen; #SKU 001.96) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with 50 bp single-end reads to obtain on average 25 million reads per sample.
For the samples of the anti-CD20 study, RNA-seq libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT sample preparation kit (Illumina) using both Sciclone and Zephyr liquid handling robotics (PerkinElmer). Library concentrations were quantified with the Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation system (Life Technologies) and the size distribution was assessed using the Experion Automated Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). For sequencing, samples were diluted and pooled into NGS libraries in equimolar amounts. Expression profiling libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 3000/4000 instruments in 50-base-pair-single-end mode.
Base calls provided by the Illumina Real-Time Analysis (RTA) software were subsequently converted into BAM format (Illumina2bam) before de-multiplexing (BamIndexDecoder) into individual, sample-specific BAM files via Illumina2bam tools (1.17.3, https://github.com/wtsi-npg/illumina2bam).
Data analysis and statistical information
All statistical tests were performed using R version 3.5.1 (ref. ). The complete R scripts, including the processed input data for all datasets and plots shown in this manuscript, are available as Jupyter notebooks in Supplementary Software 1.
For proteomics data analysis, RAW files were converted to the MGF files using ProteoWizard’s msConvert tool (version 3.0.9393) using vendor libraries. Peak list files were searched using MSGF+ (ref. ) (version 10089) and X!Tandem (version 2017.2.1.2). The precursor tolerance was set to 10 ppm, fragment tolerance to 0.01 Da for X!Tandem, and machine type to QExactive with HCD fragmentation in MSGF+, and 1 missed cleavage was allowed. TMT tags and carbamidomethylation of C were set as fixed modifications, oxidation of M and deamidation of N and Q, and phosphorylation of S, T, and Y (TiO2-enriched samples only) as variable modifications. Searches were performed against the human SwissProt database (version 17–02), combined with sequences of common contaminants and reversed decoy sequences. Search results were filtered based on the target-decoy strategy at 0.01 FDR if both search engines identified the same sequences, diverging results were discarded, and spectra only identified by one search engines filtered at 0.001 FDR (search engine specific).
For quantitation all spectra with >30% interference based on total ion current were discarded. Isotope impurity correction and normalization of intensity values was performed using the R Bioconductor package isobar (version 1.26). Protein abundance was estimated using the R Bioconductor package MSnbase (version 2.6.3) using the iPQF method and only peptides uniquely mapping to a single protein. Differential expression analysis was performed using the R Bioconductor package limma (version 3.35.3). The linear model included the MS run, patient, cell type (PBMCB vs. TAB) as factors next to the treatment group.
For transcriptomics data analysis, Bam files were converted to FASTQ format using the samtools package (https://github.com/samtools/samtools, version 0.1.19). The first nine amino acids were removed using the fastx_trimmer tool (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit, 0.0.14). Alignment was performed using the STAR aligner (version 2.5.3a, 23104886) with the output set to read counts. Alignment was performed against the Ensembl human genome 38 (version 88). Differential expression was assessed using the Bioconductor R package edgeR (version 3.22). Genes with less than 100 transcripts found in all samples were discarded prior to analysis. The linear model included the patient and cell type next to the treatment.
Pathway analysis was performed using the Camera algorithm as implemented in limma against the Molecular Signatures Database (MSIGDB, v6.1) hallmark and C2 canonical pathways collection. The analysis was performed separately for proteomics and transcriptomics data and merged using the Cytoscape Enrichment Map plugin (version 3.1.0).
Cell type abundance in whole tissue samples was estimated using xCell (R package version 1.1.0). Abundance of custom signatures was estimated using the ssGSEA approach as implemented in the Bioconductor R package GSVA (version 1.28.0).
Public datasets
To create our curated, key functional signatures, we extracted highly correlating genes from the datasets from cutaneous melanoma samples of TCGA using the Bioconductor R Package geneRecommender (version 1.52). TCGA mRNA expression data were extracted using cBioPortal’s R interface using the CGDS-R package (version 1.2.5). Survival analysis was performed using the survival package (version 2.42-6, https://github.com/therneau/survival).
We used the data from Riaz et al. to evaluate the effects of anti-PD-1 therapy on our signatures. The TPM normalized expression values were downloaded from GEO (GSE91061). Signature expression levels were estimated using the ssGSEA approach and cell type abundances estimated using xCell (see above).
scRNA-seq from Sade-Feldman et al. was directly downloaded from GEO as TPM normalized expression values (GSE120575). The complete data analysis was performed in R using Seurat 2.3.4 (ref. ). The data were normalized using the “LogNormalize” function with a scale factor of 10,000. Variable genes were detected using the “LogVMR” dispersion function and the “ExpMean” function to calculate means. The x.low.cutoff was set to 0.0125, x.high.cutoff to 3, and the y.cutoff to 0.5. Next, the data were scaled regressing out the patient identifier. Out of 100 calculated principal components, the first 35 were used for further analysis. Cells were clustered using Seurath’s graph-based clustering algorithm based on the principal components using a resolution of 0.6. Subsequent cell types were annotated based on canonical markers and all B cell-like cells retained. B cells were again clustered using a resolution of 0.9. Clusters were annotated based on the found markers (function FindMarkers, min.pct set to 0.25), as well as the expression of canonical B cell markers. Signature expression levels were estimated using the ssGSEA function (see above) based on the average gene expressions. The complete workflow can be found in Supplementary File 1 as a Jupyter notebook.
Histology
Whole tissue sections were obtained from human melanoma metastases almost exclusively derived from cutaneous and subcutaneous sites (Supplementary Table 1 for details). All tumor samples were obtained with informed patients’ consent and retrieved from the pathology files of the Medical University of Vienna (ethics vote: 405/2006). Diagnosis was based on the review of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from FFPE blocks by two authors of this study (P.P., S.N.W.), respectively. In selected tumor samples, S-100, HMB45, or triple CSPG/β3 integrin/HMB45 melanoma marker immunostainings were done to identify tumor cells and to confirm the diagnosis..
Multiplex IHC staining
Four-micrometer sections from full FFPE blocks from metastatic human melanoma and control tonsil tissue were utilized for both, the initial establishment of staining conditions for each individual primary antibody (Ab) and the successive optimization of multiplex staining. In a first step, primary Abs against the following antigens were established as single stains initially on human tonsil tissue and thereafter on metastatic human melanoma tumors.
The used antibodies were CD19 (Rabbit monoclonal, clone EPR5906, 1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab134114), CD20 (Mouse monoclonal, clone L26, 1:2000, Dako, M0755), CD27 (Rabbit monoclonal, clone EPR8569, 1:500, Abcam, ab131254), CD38 (Mouse monoclonal, clone AT13/5, 1:1350, Dako, F7101), CD138 (mouse monoclonal, clone MI15, 1:1350, Agilent, M7228), CD5 (Mouse monoclonal, clone 4C7, 1:600, Novocastra, NCL-L-CD5-4C7), IL-10 (Rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:800, Proteintech, 20850-1-AP), CD8 (Mouse monoclonal, clone C8/144B, 1:900, Biocare Medical, ACI 3160C), FoxP3 (Rabbit monoclonal, clone D2W8E, 1:400, Cell Signaling Technology, 98377S), CD4 (Mouse monoclonal, clone 4B12, 1:500, Dako, M7310), CD69 (Rabbit polyclonal, HPA050525, 1:100, Sigma-Aldrich, HPA050525), CD103 (Rabbit monoclonal, clone EPR4166(2), 1:4000, Abcam, ab129202), CD45RO (Mouse monoclonal, clone UCHL1, 1:2500, Dako, M0742), CXCL13 (Rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:1800, Proteintech, 10927-1-AP), CD21 (Rabbit polyclonal IgG, 1:3600, Proteintech, 24374-1-AP), CD23 (Rabbit monoclonal, clone SP23, 1:900, Novus Biologicals, NB120-16702), Bcl6 (Mouse monoclonal, clone 1E6B1, 1:9000, Proteintech, 66340-1-Ig).
In a second step, multiplex immunostains were established essentially as described. Random integration of sequential Abs within a multiplex panel may lead to imbalanced signals, incomplete staining through interference with previously applied tyramide signal amplification (TSA), disruption of epitopes, and removal of TSA fluorophores because of repetitive antigen-retrievals at high temperature. Therefore, each Ab was tested individually for its optimal position in the sequence of multiplex staining to minimize interference with previous Ab-TSA complexes or by alteration of epitopes.
For multiplex immunostains, 4-μm sections were deparaffinized and antigen retrieval was performed in heated citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and/or Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9) for 30 min. Thereafter, sections were fixed with 7.5% neutralized formaldehyde (SAV Liquid Production GmbH). Each section was subjected to six successive rounds of Ab staining, each consisting of protein blocking with 20% normal goat serum (Dako) in PBS, incubation with primary Abs, biotinylated anti-mouse/rabbit secondary antibodies and Streptavidin-HRP (Dako, 50003), followed by TSA visualization with fluorophores Opal 520, Opal 540, Opal 570, Opal 620, Opal 650, and Opal 690 (PerkinElmer) diluted in 1X Plus Amplification Diluent (PerkinElmer), Ab-TSA complex-stripping in heated citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and/or Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9) for 30 min and fixation with 7.5% neutralized formaldehyde. Thereafter, nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (PerkinElmer) and sections mounted with PermaFluor fluorescence mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Respective stainings without primary antibodies were used as a negative control. At equal Ab-concentrations, TSA-based visualization is expected to yield a higher number of positive cells as compared to conventional immunofluorescence. We therefore established TSA-based visualization of primary Abs on control tonsil tissue, the golden standard for lymphocyte antigen detection in pathology, and performed a comparison for each Ab to validated staining patterns in human tonsil (as to the Human Protein Atlas, available from www.proteinatlas.org). Thereafter, we balanced the signal through dilution of the primary Abs to obtain staining levels and cell frequencies comparable to conventional immunofluorescence staining. The dilution of the CD19 antibody was optimized to allowing for the detection of CD19low plasma cell-like cells as compared to patterns and frequencies obtained by CD138+ pooled IgA/IgG+ stainings on human tonsil and melanoma. In multiplex stainings, single primary Ab stainings were run in parallel to control for false-positive results through incomplete Ab-TSA complex-stripping and false-negative results through antigen masking (by incubation with multiple primary Abs, umbrella-effect). Spillover effects were controlled for anti-CD20-Ab stainings on tonsil with different Opal fluorophores by signal detection in adjacent components/channels and thereafter for exposure time settings upon acquisition of multiplex-stained tissue sections.
Tissue imaging, spectral unmixing, and phenotyping
Multiplexed slides were scanned on a Vectra Multispectral Imaging System version 2 (Perkin Elmer) as described. Briefly, a spectral library from spectral peaks emitted by each fluorophore from single stained slides was created with the Advanced Image Analysis software (InForm 2.4, PerkinElmer) and used for spectral unmixing of multispectral images allowing for identification of all markers of interest. Autofluorescence was determined on an unstained representative study sample.
TAB subset phenotyping in whole tumor sections: cells were phenotyped as (i) CD19+ CD20− CD38+ CD138− plasmablast-like, CD19+ CD20− CD138+ plasma cell-like, CD19+ CD20+ CD38− CD138− CD27+ memory B cell-like, CD20+ CD38+ CD138− CD5− germinal center B cell like, CD19+ CD20− CD38− CD138− CD27+ activated B cell-like, CD20+ CD19− CD138− CD5+ transitional/regulatory cell-like TAB and (ii) other cells. The staining protocol has been optimized for detection of CD19. Though CD19low plasma cell-like cells could be detected at significant numbers, they may still be underrepresented in our staining data. The same may also be true for the detection of activated B cell-like cells, as expression of CD27 has been reported to be downregulated on TAB. After adaptive cell segmentation, cut-off values for each fluorophore/antibody staining were defined. All phenotyping and subsequent quantifications were performed blinded to the sample identity.
TAB and T cell subset distribution in intra- and extratumoral stromal tumor areas: was performed in whole tumor sections assisted by the automated tissue segmentation tool of the InForm software (v.2.4, PerkinElmer), which had been trained to recognize intratumor and extratumoral stromal areas based on tissue morphology including the presence and absence, respectively, of melanoma cells. Total cell counts were determined by DAPI+ cell numbers referred to the total tumor area, six-color multiplex immunostaining (CD20, CD19, CD8, CD4, FoxP3, DAPI) was used for the detection of CD20+CD19+, CD20+CD19−, and CD20−CD19+ TAB and CD8+, CD4+FoxP3−, and CD4+FoxP3+ cells. Further T cell subsets were identified by an additional seven-color multiplex immunostaining and phenotyped according to refs.  as CD8+CD4−CD69+CD103+ and CD8−CD4+CD69+CD103− cells corresponding to a tissue-resident memory T cell phenotype (TRM); CD8+CD4−CD45RO+CD27+ and CD8−CD4+CD45RO+CD27+ cells corresponding to a central memory T cell phenotype (TCM); CD8+CD4−CD45RO+CD27− and CD8−CD4+CD45RO+CD27− cells corresponding to an effector memory T cell phenotype (TEM); and other CD8+CD4− or CD8−CD4+ T cells.
TLSs were identified according to Silina et al. by a further seven-color multiplex immunostaining. Primary follicle-like TLS were identified as CD4+ and CD20+ lymphocyte aggregates with CXCL13 and CD21 but not CD23 expression; immature secondary follicle-like TLS by additional CD23 expression; and mature secondary follicle-like TLS by accessory expression of Bcl6. In on-anti-CD20 therapy samples, TLS were identified along the same criteria, without the presence of CD20 lymphocyte aggregates. Trainable tissue segmentation was performed using the automated tissue segmentation tool of the InForm software (v.2.4, PerkinElmer). TLS areas (as determined by pixels) were read in whole tumor tissue sections and referred to the total tumor area (as determined by pixels).
