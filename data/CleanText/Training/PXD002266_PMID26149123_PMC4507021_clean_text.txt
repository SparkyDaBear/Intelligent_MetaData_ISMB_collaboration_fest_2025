ABSTRACT:
Our understanding of the key phosphorylation-dependent signalling pathways in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, remains rudimentary. Here we address this issue for the essential cGMP-dependent protein kinase, PfPKG. By employing chemical and genetic tools in combination with quantitative global phosphoproteomics, we identify the phosphorylation sites on 69 proteins that are direct or indirect cellular targets for PfPKG. These PfPKG targets include proteins involved in cell signalling, proteolysis, gene regulation, protein export and ion and protein transport, indicating that cGMP/PfPKG acts as a signalling hub that plays a central role in a number of core parasite processes. We also show that PfPKG activity is required for parasite invasion. This correlates with the finding that the calcium-dependent protein kinase, PfCDPK1, is phosphorylated by PfPKG, as are components of the actomyosin complex, providing mechanistic insight into the essential role of PfPKG in parasite egress and invasion.
 Protein kinases expressed by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum represent potentially valuable drug targets. Alam et al. identify proteins whose phosphorylation is dependent on the kinase PfPKG, revealing a regulatory network controlling parasite egress from red blood cells and calcium signalling.

Methods
Parasite culture and synchronization of parasites
P. falciparum blood stage 3D7 (wild type)-, PKGT618Q- and CDPK1-HA-parasites were cultured using a standard method. Parasites were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 2 g l−1 NaHCO3, 27.2 mg l−1 hypoxanthine and 0.5% Albumax II, pH7.4) using O+ human RBC at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2, 5% O2 and 90% N2. PKGT618Q and CDPK1-HA parasites were grown with the selection drug WR99210 (10 nM). Sorbitol treatment was used to synchronize the parasites: parasites were treated with 5% sorbitol for 20 min at room temperature to lyse trophozoite and schizont stage parasites. Dead parasites were removed by two washes with incomplete RPMI medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Following sorbitol treatment parasites were transferred to complete RPMI 1640 medium.
For the time-course experiments, parasites were synchronized by two rounds of sorbitol treatment—first treatment when the parasites culture was at late ring/trophozoite stage and second when the parasite culture contained schizonts and ring stage parasites. After second sorbitol treatment, parasite cultures were collected for the first time point (8 h) and further samples were collected at every 8 h as indicated. Please note that we calculated that each time point has variation of ±2 h. Parasites from infected cells for the first three time points (8, 16 and 24 h) were collected by two saponin treatments (0.1%) for 10 min. Subsequent time points (32, 40 and 48 h) were collected by magnet-assisted cell sorter (MACS) purification followed by saponin treatment (0.1%) for 10 min. The parasite fractions were then washed at least three times with PBS before being prepared for gel electrophoresis.
Cloning of CDPK1 and site-directed mutagenesis
Bacterial expression of full-length PfCDPK1 was achieved by amplification of the Pfcdpk1-coding sequence from a 3D7 schizonts cDNA preparation using CDPK1-FL-His-Fwd and CDPK1-FL-His-Rev primers (see primer list) and cloning into pLEICS05 plasmid (PROTEX, University of Leicester, UK), which produces a PfCDPK1 protein with a 6-HIS tag at the C-terminus. For expression of PfCDPK1 as an N-terminal GST-tagged protein, the Pfcdpk1 gene was amplified using CDPK1-FL-GST-Fwd and CDPK1-FL-GST-Rev primers and cloned in pGEX-2T plasmid (GE Healthcare). Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II kit, Agilent Technologies), using primers CDPK1-D191N-Fwd and CDPK1-D191N-Rev, was performed to convert aspartate to asparagine at residue-191 of PfCDPK1 to generate the kinase dead variant, CDPK1-KD. Similarly, serine-64 on PfCDPK1 was changed to alanine using the primers CDPK1-S64A-Fwd and CDPK1-S64A-Rev primers.
Generation and screening of parasites expressing CDPK1-HA
A plasmid containing a recodonized version of base pairs 436–1,572 of the pfcdpk1 ORF between XmaI (5′) and AvrII (3′) cloning sites was synthesized by GeneArt. The synthetic sequence also contained a novel EcoRI site at position 436–441, produced through introduction of synonymous mutations. A region of homology to facilitate integration of the plasmid via single crossover homologous recombination was amplified from P. falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA: 194 bp upstream of the ATG to base pair 435 of the open reading frame using primers 1 and 2. This fragment was cloned via XmaI and EcoRI sites into the GeneArt vector containing the recodonized gene. Finally, the combined 2.5 kb fragment containing the native and recodonized cdpk1 sequences was cloned between XmaI and AvrII sites of the pHH4-HA plasmid (gift from Dr E. Knuepfer, NIMR), which adds a triple HA tag at the 3′ end followed by a stop codon and the PbDT 3′ UTR and hDHFR drug selection cassette.
P. falciparum 3D7 parasites were transfected with 100 μg pHH4-CDPK1-HA plasmid using standard methods. They were maintained under drug pressure (25 nM WR99210) until resistant parasites emerged, cycled on/off drug and cloned by limiting dilution. Clones were screened by PCR using primers 4 and 5 to detect integration at the cdpk1 locus, and primers 4 and 6 which would amplify from the unmodified locus (Supplementary Fig. 7). Positive clones were confirmed by western blot using anti-CDPK1 (described elsewhere and anti-HA (3F10; Roche) antibodies.
Immunofluorescence assays
Smears were prepared from PfCDPK1-HA transgenic parasite culture containing schizonts after treatment with vehicle or Compound 2 (2 μM, 60 min) and 3D7 parasite culture containing schizonts and merozoites. Smears were dried for 30 min and washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 10 min. Smears were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min, washed with TBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Slides were blocked overnight at 4 °C using 4% BSA. Smears were probed with a rabbit antisera raised against phosphoserine-64 on PfCDPK1 (CDPK1-pS64), a monoclonal rat anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10) and a rat antibody against recombinant PfCDPK1 (CDPK1) at 1:100 dilution in TBS containing 1% BSA. Mouse sera against PfEBA175 and PfTRAMP were also used at 1:100 dilution in TBS containing 1% BSA as markers for apical organelles. Alexa-Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rat IgG goat antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) and Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) were used as secondary antibodies with PfCDPK1-HA transgenic parasite. Alexa-Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rat IgG goat antibodies (1:500 dilution), Alexa-Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG goat antibodies (1:500 dilution) and Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat antibodies (1:200 dilution) were used as secondary antibodies with 3D7 parasites. Slides were mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) and anti-fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes) and analysed using either a Nikon A1-R confocal microscope (for 3D7 parasites) or a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 confocal microscope (for PfCDPK1-HA parasites).
Images (labelled as rendered images in the manuscript) were processed using Imaris version 6.4.2 or 7.0.0 (Bitplane Scientific), which enables visualization, segmentation and interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) microscopy data sets. For clarity of display, deconvoluted z stacks were reconstructed in 3D, with interpolation. To see the extent of co-localization between PfCDPK1-pS64 (green) and PfCDPK1 (red) a separate co-localization channel (shown in yellow; PfCDPK1+PfCDPK1-pS64) was built. The red channel (for PfCDPK1) was made transparent to allow visualization of DAPI and staining for PfCDPK1 (green) or overlap of PfCDPK1-pS64 and PfCDPK1.
Bacterial protein expression
Full-length PfCDPK1 as a 6-HIS- or GST-tagged protein was expressed in the BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL strain (Agilent Technologies) of E. coli. Cells were treated with 100 μM IPTG when the optical density of the cell culture at 600 nm reached 0.6, and gene expression was induced for 4 h at 22 °C.
To purify 6-HIS-tagged CDPK1, cells were lysed in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) pH7.4) by sonication. After sonication lysates were centrifuged at 20,000g for 30 min and supernatants were collected. Supernatants were loaded on pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA Superflow resin (QIAGEN). Loaded resin was washed with buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 7.4) and proteins eluted with the same buffer containing 350 mM Imidazole, at pH 8.0. Eluted proteins were dialysed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT, pH7.4.
To purify GST-tagged PfCDPK1, cells were lysed in buffer (PBS containing 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), pH7.4) by sonication. After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 20,000g for 30 min and the supernatant collected. Supernatant was loaded on pre-equilibrated glutathione Sepharose-4B resin (GE Healthcare). Loaded resin was washed with PBS containing 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA, pH7.4, and protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 20 mM reduced glutathione. Eluted proteins were dialysed in dialysis buffer and stored at −80 °C.
Antibody generation
PfCDPK1 ‘structural' antibody (recognizing both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated PfCDPK1) was raised by immunizing rats with recombinant CDPK1-6HIS protein by Eurogentec, using a standard 87-day immunization protocol. Briefly two rats were immunized with 30 μg of protein on day 0 followed by boosts on days 14, 28 and 56. The final bleed was collected on day 87. IgG from the serum was purified on Protein G-Sepharose fast flow (GE Healthcare) and used for the study.
Phospho-specific Serine-64 PfCDPK1 antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with phospho-peptide CKVRKLGS(PO3H2)GAYGE. Rabbit immunizations and purification of phospho-specific antibody was done by Eurogentec following their 87-day immunization protocol. Briefly two rabbits were immunized with peptide coupled to KLH carrier on day 0 followed by three boosts on day 21, 49 and 77, and the final bleed was collected on day 87. ELISA against peptide and carrier was used to select the final serum sample with the best titre for the purification of phospho-specific antibody. Specific antibody was purified by two rounds of purification: first, the serum was passed through a column with conjugated phospho-peptide, then the bound antibodies were eluted and passed through a second column with conjugated non-phosphorylated peptide (CKVRKLGSGAYGE). The flow-through that contained the phospho-specific antibody, as confirmed by ELISA, was collected.
The phosopho-specific antibody to PfMyoA phospho-serine 19 was produced by Genosphere Biotechnologies. Rabbits were immunized with the peptide ‘N'-RRV[pS]NVEAFDKC conjugated to KLH. The resulting antisera was affinity-purified on the phosphopeptide followed by affinity chromatography on the non-phosphopeptide. The flow-through from the second purification contains a majority of anti-phospho-peptide antibodies and was used in western blots at a dilution of 1:1,000.
Labelling of PfCDPK1-HA parasites and immunoprecipitation
Late schizont-stage PfCDPK1-HA parasites were harvested on a MACS column (Miltenyi Biotec) in Krebs buffer (10 mM HEPES, containing 118.4 mM NaCl, 4.69 mM KCl, 4.17 mM NaHCO3, 1.18 mM MgSO4, 1.29 mM CaCl2 and 11.7 mM glucose, pH7.4). Purified schizonts were pre-incubated with vehicle (0.2% dimethyl sulphoxide) or 2 μM Compound 2 for 10 min at 37 °C, then 32P-orthophosphate (7.4 MBq) was added and the incubation continued at 37 °C for 30 min. The schizonts were washed twice with Krebs buffer and resuspended in 0.1% (w/v) saponin in PBS for 10 min on ice. Following saponin treatment, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer-A (20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM β-Glycerol Phosphate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche), pH7.4). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000g for 5 min and the supernatant used for immunoprecipitation. To immunoprecipitate CDPK1-HA, the supernatant was incubated with 20 μl HA-affinity matrix (immobilized anti-HA high-affinity rat monoclonal antibody, clone 3F10 (Roche)) at 4 °C for 1 h with constant mixing. The matrix was then washed five times with lysis buffer-A without NP-40, and an equal volume of Laemmli buffer was added to the matrix. Proteins were separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and stained with Coomassie blue before the gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film.
In vitro kinase assays for PfPKG
CDPK1-HIS (1 μg) or CDPK1-S64A-HIS (1 μg) proteins were incubated with or without Histone Type IIA (2 μg), Myelin Basic Protein (2 μg; MBP) and α-Casein (2 μg) in kinase buffer (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT, pH7.4) containing 1 mM CaCl2, 50 μM ATP and 0.0185 MBq 32P-ATP for 30 min at 30 °C.
To examine the phosphorylation of PfCDPK1-KD by PfPKG in an in vitro kinase assay, recombinant HIS-tagged PfPKG protein (1 μg) was incubated with or without CDPK1-KD protein (1 μg) in kinase buffer containing 10 μM cGMP, 50 μM ATP and 0.0185 MBq P32-ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. CDPK1-KD (1 μg) was incubated in a similar condition without cGMP.
Following incubation, reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli buffer and proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE on a 10% gel and stained with Coomassie blue. Dried gels were exposed to X-ray film and autoradiograms collected.
To examine phosphorylation of PfCDPK1 at serine-64, PfPKG-HIS tagged (50 ng) was incubated with or without CDPK1-KD (50 ng) and CDPK1-S64A-KD (50 ng) in kinase buffer containing 10 μM cGMP and 50 μM ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. CDPK1-KD (50 ng) and CDPK1-S64A-KD (50 ng) were also incubated in a similar condition without cGMP. Following incubation, the reaction was stopped with Laemmli buffer and samples were used for SDS–PAGE and western blotting.
PfCDPK1 protein kinase activity assay
Recombinant His-tagged WT or S64A variant PfCDPK1 were assayed for protein kinase activity using MBP as a substrate. In the first part of the assay, recombinant PfCDPK1-6His was incubated in the presence or absence of PfPKG-His plus 10 μM cGMP in the reaction mix containing 50 μM ATP and 32P-ATP in kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.5) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following the incubation, PfPKG-dependent phosphorylation of PfCDPK1 was stopped by adding Compound 2 to a final concentration of 2 μM and further incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The same amount of Compound 2 was added to control samples not containing PfPKG to exclude any inhibitory effect of the compound on PfCDPK1 in the second part of the assay. Protein kinase activity of PfCDPK1 was assayed by transferring 75% of the first reaction mix into a clean Eppendorf tube containing 2 μg MBP, 1 mM CaCl2, 50 μM ATP and 32P-ATP in the kinase buffer at 30 °C, and incubation for different times. The reaction was stopped by transferring samples into ice and spotting 20 μl aliquots onto P-81 phospho-cellulose paper (Whatman). The P-81 paper was washed with 0.5% phosphoric acid to remove nonspecific background and incorporated radioactivity was measured.
Western blotting
Twenty micrograms of parasite lysates or 50 ng of recombinant proteins were resolved by SDS–PAGE on a 10% gel. After separation, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk solution in Tris buffer-saline (pH 7.4) containing 1% Tween-20. Then membranes were probed with either structural CDPK1 antibody (1:1,000 dilution), pS64-phospho-specific CDPK1 antibody (1:1,000) or monoclonal HA antibody (1:1,000). HRP-tagged rat or rabbit secondary antibody was used at 1:2,000 dilution. Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and fluorograms were collected.
EBA-175 antibody (1:1000) used was an in house antibody generated in the Tobin laboratory against recombinant EBA-175 region III-IV.
Invasion assay with live merozoites
Merozoites used in the invasion assay were purified as described earlier. Briefly, 3D7 or PfPKGT618Q parasites were synchronized by two sorbitol treatments in the same cycle. Schizonts from 120 ml parasite culture with 4% haematocrit and 2–4% parasitemia were purified on a MACS column. Purified schizonts were treated with 10 μM N-(trans-Epoxysuccinyl)-L-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide (E-64) in complete RPMI medium for 4 h and then schizonts were passed through an Acrodisc 1.2 μm pore membrane syringe filter (Pall Corporation) to collect free merozoites. Free merozoites were added to complete RPMI 1640 medium containing RBC and either 2 μM Compound 2 or the vehicle (dimethyl sulphoxide), then parasites were allowed to invade RBC and grow for 24 h under standard culturing conditions. In one well, Compound 2 was added 1 h post invasion and parasites were allowed to develop to the 24-h time point. Smears were made, stained with Giemsa stain and the percentage of infected RBC was counted by microscopy. The experiment was done three times with duplicate wells for each condition.
Gel-filtration on Superdex 200
PfCDPK1-HA or PfPKGT618Q parasites were cultured in complete RPMI medium until late schizont stage and harvested on a MACS column. Purified schizonts were resuspended in the same medium, split into two equal aliquots and incubated in the presence of either 10 μM E-64 and 2 μM Compound 2 or 10 μM E-64 and vehicle alone, for 3 h at 37 °C. Following the treatment, samples were incubated on ice with 0.1% saponin in PBS supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), the cells were harvested by centrifugation and cell pellets washed twice with TEG buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5% β-Glycerol phosphate, pH 7.4,supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The parasite pellets were lysed in TEG buffer (plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors) in the presence of 0.1% NP-40 for 10 min on ice followed by 4 × 10 s sonication. Samples were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000g for 3 min and the supernatant fraction was collected and centrifuged again at 20,000g for 3 min to remove any further insoluble material. Protein concentration in the soluble lysate was in the range of 2.5–3.0 mg per ml in a final volume of ∼0.5 ml.
This sample (300–350 μl) was then loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare, 10 × 300 mm) equilibrated with running buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM β-glycerol phosphate, pH7.4) and run at a flow rate of 50 μl per min at 4 °C on an AKTA Purifier (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analysed by western blot—probed with antibodies against the HA-tag or the structural CDPK-antibody.
Preparation of P. falciparum proteins for mass spectrometry
Late-stage schizonts (segmented) were harvested on a MACS CS column (Miltenyi Biotec) in complete RPMI 1640 medium. The parasites were split into two equal aliquots and incubated in the presence or absence of Compound 2 (2 μM) for 1 h at 37 °C in complete RPMI 1640 medium. Following incubation, the parasites were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1% (w/v) saponin in PBS supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) and incubated 10 min at 4 °C. The saponin-treated parasites were collected by centrifugation and then lysed with TEG buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5% β-glycerol phosphate, 1% NP-40, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000g for 3 min, and the supernatant collected. The pellet was resuspended in TEG buffer without NP-40 and sonicated 3 × 15 s on ice and then centrifuged at 20,000g for 3 min. The two supernatant fractions were then pooled. Protein concentration in the final lysates was in the range of 2–4 mg ml−1 in a total volume of 0.45–0.5 ml depending on the initial number of cells.
Tryptic digestion and TMT labelling of parasite proteins
Parasite lysates were diluted in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.4) to give a final measure of 0.6–0.7 mg protein in 1 ml total volume. This was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence 10 mM DTT and 0.1% SDS. Iodoacetamide (1 M solution) was then added to a final concentration of 100 mM and incubation was continued for another 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Protein was precipitated on ice by addition of 100% trichloroacetic acid (at a ratio of 1:4) to the samples and harvested by centrifugation for 3 min at 2,000g followed by two gentle washes without disturbing the pellets. The protein pellets were sonicated in 50 mM TEAB buffer (triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5) and digested with trypsin (Promega) at a ratio of 1:20 (w/w) trypsin to protein content, overnight at 37 °C on a rotating platform.
For tandem mass tag labelling (TMT labelling), completely digested samples were concentrated to about 250–300 μl in a Speedvac centrifuge and labelled with 6-plex TMT reagents (Thermo scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. TMT-labelled samples were pooled and concentrated to a volume of 750 μl in a Speedvac centrifuge, and then mixed with 250 μl of 100% acetonitrile (ACN) and diluted with 10 mM TEAB, pH 8.0 to a final volume of 3 ml. The sample was loaded onto a Resource Q anion-exchange column (1 ml bed volume, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mM TEAB, pH 8.0. Peptides were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–1 M NaCl in 10 mM TEAB, pH 7.0, collecting 1 ml fractions. The fractions associated with the flow-through (fractions 2–4) were combined and wash fractions (fractions 5–7) were combined. The flow-through and wash fractions were then concentrated on a speedvac to 1 ml total volume for each. The combined flow-through and wash fractions together with each of the gradient eluate fractions (fractions 10–16) were prepared for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) enrichment of phosphopeptides.
IMAC enrichment of phosphopeptides for mass spectrometry
Fractions from the anion exchange column step were adjusted to pH 2.5–3.0 by adding 50% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). PHOS-Select beads (Sigma) were equilibrated with loading/wash buffer (0.25 M acetic acid, 30% acetonitrile) and 50 μl of 50% slurry was added to each fraction, followed by rotating at room temperature for 1–2 h. After incubation with IMAC beads, the samples were transferred onto Mobicol ‘Classic' spin columns (2B Scientific Ltd), centrifuged for 30 s at 1,000g, and the flow-through (filtrate) collected and used for further enrichment on TiO2 beads as described below. The IMAC beads were washed twice with 200 μl of loading/wash solution, once with 200 μl of HPLC grade water and eluted twice with 100 μl of eluting solution composed of 22 μl ammonia solution (Fisher Chemical, 35% stock), 300 μl acetonitrile to a total volume of 1 ml with water. Eluates were concentrated to a small volume (15–20 μl) on a Speedvac centrifuge and submitted for mass spectrometry analysis.
TiO2 enrichment of phosphopeptides for mass spectrometry
The filtrates from the PHOS-Select-treated samples were used for further phosphopeptide enrichment essentially as described in ref.. Briefly, each sample was treated with 5 mg of TiO2 beads (GL Sciences Inc) in the presence of 30 mg 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid for 1–2 h on a rotating platform at room temperature. Following treatment, the samples were filtered on Mobicol ‘Classic' spin columns, then the beads were washed once with 200 μl of 30% ACN, 0.5% TFA and once with the same volume of 80% ACN, 0.1% TFA by centrifugation for 30 s at 1,000g. Phosphopeptides bound to the TiO2 beads were eluted twice with 100 μl of 15% ammonia solution. Eluates were concentrated to a small volume (15–20 μl) and submitted for mass spectrometry analysis.
Mass spectrometry and data processing
LC-MS/MS was carried out using an RSLCnano HPLC system (Dionex) and an LTQ-Orbitrap-Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Samples were loaded at high-flow rate onto a reverse-phase trap column (0.3 mm i.d. × 1 mm), containing 5 μm C18 300 Å Acclaim PepMap medium (Dionex) maintained at a temperature of 37 °C. The loading buffer was 0.1% formic acid/0.05% TFA/2% ACN. Peptides were eluted from the column at a flow rate of 0.3 μl min−1 and passed through a reverse-phase PicoFrit capillary column (75 μm i.d. × 400 mm) containing Symmetry C18 100 Å medium (Waters) that was packed in-house using a high-pressure device (Proxeon Biosystems). Peptides were eluted over a period of 4 h, with the output of the column sprayed directly into the nanospray ion source of the LTQ-Orbitrap-Velos mass spectrometer.
The LTQ-Orbitrap-Velos mass spectrometer was set to acquire a 1 microscan Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS) scan event at 60,000 resolution over the m/z range 300–2,000 Da in positive ion mode. The maximum injection time for MS was 500 ms and the AGC target setting was 1e6. Accurate calibration of the FTMS scan was achieved using a background ion lock mass for C6H10O14S3 (401.922718 Da). Subsequently, up to ten data-dependent higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) MS/MS were triggered from the FTMS scan. The isolation width was 2.0 Da, with normalized collision energy of 42.5. Dynamic exclusion was enabled. The maximum injection time for MS/MS was 250 ms and the AGC target setting was 5e4.
The raw data file obtained from each LC-MS/MS acquisition was processed using Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4.0.288, Thermo Scientific), searching each file in turn using Mascot (version 2.2.04, Matrix Science Ltd.) against the UniProtKB-Swissprot database. The peptide tolerance was set to 10 p.p.m. and the MS/MS tolerance was set to 0.02 Da. Fixed modifications were set as carboxyamidomethyl (C) and variable modifications set as oxidation (M) and phosphorylation (S/T/Y). A decoy database search was performed.
The output from Proteome Discoverer was further processed using Scaffold Q+S (version 4.0.5, Proteome Software). Upon import, the data were searched using X!Tandem (The Global Proteome Machine Organization). PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet (Institute for Systems Biology) probability thresholds of 95% were calculated from the decoy searches and Scaffold was used to calculate an improved 95% peptide and protein probability threshold based on the data from the two different search algorithms.
Phosphoproteomic data analysis
Plotting the log2 mean fold change of the total peptides from each of the three experiments with wild-type parasites revealed a normal distribution of differences in peptide abundance resulting from the treatment of parasites with Compound 2 (Supplementary Fig. 8). The phospho-peptides that appeared in the lower quartile of the distribution curve in all three wild-type parasite experiments were considered to be downregulated by the treatment with Compound 2.
Next, we examined whether those phosphopeptides considered as downregulated by Compound 2 treatment of wild-type parasites were also downregulated in the Compound 2-treated PfPKGT618Q parasite (note: for a phospho-peptide to be considered downregulated, it had to fall within the lower quartile of the distribution curve in all three wild-type experiments and to be detected in all three of the PfPKGT618Q parasite experiments). This was done using a mixed regression test to determine whether there was a significant difference between the log2 mean fold change of the selected phosphopeptides in the wild-type and PfPKGT618Q parasites. Those phosphopeptides that were downregulated in both the wild-type parasite and in the PfPKGT618Q mutant parasite were considered to result from off-target effects of Compound 2. In contrast, those phosphopeptides that were downregulated in the wild-type parasite samples but were significantly less downregulated in the PfPKGT618Q parasite samples were considered as resulting from on-target effects of Compound 2 and therefore constituted cellular targets of PfPKG.
