ABSTRACT:
Post-translational modification with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) alters the function of proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. SUMO-specific enzymes conjugate SUMOs to lysine residues in target proteins. Although proteomic studies have identified hundreds of sumoylated substrates, methods to identify the modified lysines on a proteomic scale are lacking. We developed a method that enabled proteome-wide identification of sumoylated lysines that involves the expression of polyhistidine (6His)-tagged SUMO2 with Thr90 mutated to Lys. Endoproteinase cleavage with Lys-C of 6His-SUMO2T90K modifed proteins from human cell lysates produced a diGly remnant on SUMO2T90K conjugated lysines enabling immunoprecipitation of SUMO2T90K modified peptides and producing a unique mass-to-charge signature. Mass spectrometry analysis of SUMO enriched peptides revealed over 1,000 sumoylated lysines in 539 proteins, including many functionally related proteins involved in cell cycle, transcription, and DNA repair. Not only can this strategy be used to study the dynamics of sumoylation and potential other similar posttranslational modifications, but also, these data provide an unprecedented resource for future research on the role of sumoylation in cellular physiology and disease.

Materials and Methods
Generation of HEK293 N3S cells stably expressing 6His-SUMO2T90K
pEFIRESpuro-6His-SUMO2 was created by cloning a PCR-generated 6His-SUMO2 fusion into the NheI and NotI sites of the plasmid vector pEFIRES-P-eYFP-C1 (), replacing the coding sequence of eYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein). The SUMO2T90K mutation was introduced into pEFIRESpuro-6His-SUMO2 by site-directed mutagenesis. The SUMO2 coding regions of all plasmids were fully sequenced. HEK293 N3S cells (Sigma-Aldrich, 92052131) grown in suspension culture were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) with pEFIRESpuro-6His-SUMO2T90K and selected with puromycin at 2 g/ml. Thereafter, stable cell populations were maintained in growth media containing 1 g/ml puromycin.
Cell culture and protein extraction
HEK293 N3S cells stably expressing 6His-SUMO2T90K were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco), supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (FCS), 1 μg/ml puromycin, and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were grown on five 175 cm2 dishes to about 90% confluency prior to their transfer into Minimum Essential medium Eagle (spinner modification; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1 g/ml puromycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin. 6 L of cell culture (~800 000 cells/ml) was stimulated by heat shock at 43 °C, harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with cold 1x DPBS (Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline; Gibco) and lysed in cell lysis buffer (6 M guanidinium-HCl, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) (6 ml of lysis buffer per 1 g of cell pellet). DNA was disrupted by short pulses of sonication, insoluble particles were removed with 0.2 μm sterile filters (Sartorius) and protein concentration was determined by BCA (bicinchoninic acid) assay (Pierce). In the experiment designed to evaluate reproducibility, duplicate 750mL cultures of HEK293 6His-SUMO2T90K corresponding to 4 × 107 cells were processed in parallel.
Nickel affinity chromatography
Nickel affinity purification of 6His-SUMO2T90K conjugates was performed with Ni2+-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) according to a published protocol () with minor changes. 250 L Ni2+-NTA agarose beads were added to the cell lysate (286 mg total protein for the primary experiment or 48mg protein for the experiment designed to evaluate reproducibility) and mixed at 4 °C for 16 hours. Beads were washed with cell lysis buffer, wash buffer pH 8.0 (8 M urea, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol), wash buffer pH 6.3 (8 M urea, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.3, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and again with wash buffer pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted in three sequential steps with 1.5 column volumes of elution buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol).
Filter aided sample preparation and protein digestion
Digestion of 6His-SUMO2T90K proteins was performed on 30 kDa cutoff filter units (Sartorius) according to a published protocol () with minor changes. Samples were concentrated on filter units, washed twice with UA buffer (200 μl of 8 M urea, 100 mM Tris pH 7.5) and treated with 50 mM chloroacetamide in UA buffer for 20 minutes in the dark. Samples were then washed twice with UA buffer, three times with 200 μl of IP buffer (50 mM MOPS-NaOH pH 7.2, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM NaCl) and digested for 16 hours with Lys-C (Wako) in 50 μl IP buffer at 37 °C (enzyme to protein ratio 1:50). Sample were collected and the filters were washed with 50 μl of IP buffer to increase the yield of Lys-C peptides. Peptides retained on the filter units were subsequently digested with endoproteinase Glu-C for 16 hours in 50 μl of IP buffer at 20°C (enzyme to protein ratio 1:100) and following collection of peptides, the filter units were again washed with additional 50 μl of IP buffer. To analyse nickel affinity purifications directly a small fraction of the nickel column elution (~ 2 μg) was diluted tenfold in 8 M urea 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, treated with 50 mM chloroacetamide for 1.5 h at 20 °C, then diluted four times with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and mixed with Lys-C (enzyme to protein ratio 1:50), followed by digestion at 20 °C for 16 hours.
Immunopurification of diGly-Lys containing peptides
Anti-K-ε-GG conjugated to protein A beads (20 μl of beads; PTMScan, Cell Signaling Technology) was washed three times with 1 ml of 50 mM sodium borate pH 9.0, resuspended in 1 ml of fresh 20 mM dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature while rotating. Beads were washed twice with 1 ml of 200 mM ethanolamine pH 8.0 for 2 h at 4 °C, three times with 1.5 ml of cold IP buffer and stored in IP buffer at 4 °C. Enrichment of diGly-Lys containing peptides with anti-KεGG was performed according to a published protocol () with minor changes. Anti-KεGG (19 g) cross-linked to protein A beads (3 L) was added to peptide mixtures (300 g for the primary experiment or 360 g for the experiment designed to evaluate reproducibility) in IP buffer and incubated at 4 °C for overnight while rotating. Beads were washed twice with 500 μl of cold 1x DPBS and peptides were eluted twice with 50 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).
Mass spectrometric analysis and data processing
Prior to mass spectrometric analysis, all peptide samples were desalted on self-made reverse-phase C18 (Empore) stop-and-go-extraction tips () and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem MS on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an EASY-nLC 1000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific) via an EASY-Spray ion source (Thermo Scientific). Purified peptides were loaded onto 75 μm × 500 mm EASY-Spray column (Thermo Scientific) at a maximum pressure of 800 bars and various gradient lengths from 90 minutes to 150 minutes were used with a linear gradient of 5 % to 22 % of solvent B (100 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid) in solvent A (0.1 % formic acid), followed by a ramp to 40% of solvent B. Flow rate was set to 250 nl/min and eluting peptides were injected online into the mass spectrometer. Various Q Exactive settings were tested depending on the complexity of the samples, however optimal data acquisition for low complexity diGly-Lys containing peptides was achieved with the following parameters: Precursor ion full scan spectra (m/z 300 to 1,600) were acquired with a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 400 (target value of 1,000,000 ions, maximum injection time 20 ms). Up to one data dependent MS2 spectrum was acquired with a resolution of 35,000 at m/z 400 (target value of 500,000 ions, maximum injection time 1,000 ms). Ions with unassigned charge state, and singly or highly (>8) charged ions were rejected. Intensity threshold was set to 2.1 × 104 units. Peptide match was set to preferred and dynamic exclusion option was enabled (exclusion duration 40 s).
Data analysis and manual validation of the results
Raw mass spectrometric data files were processed using MaxQuant software (version 1.3.0.5) () and searched against UniProtKB human proteome (canonical and isoform sequences; downloaded in April 2013). Enzyme specificity was set to cleave peptide bonds C-terminally to Lys residues for samples treated with Lys-C only or C-terminally to Glu, Asp, and Lys residues for samples digested with Lys-C and Glu-C. A maximum number of three or five missed cleavages were allowed for samples cleaved with Lys-C, or Lys-C and Glu-C, respectively. Carbamidomethylation of Cys was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of Met, acetylation of protein N-termini, phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, and Tyr, and diGly adduction to Lys (except in peptide C-terminus) were set as variable modifications. A minimum peptide length was set to seven amino acids and a maximum peptide mass was 10,000 Da. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1 % was set as a threshold at both protein and peptide level, and a mass deviation of 6 parts per million was set for main search and 0.5 Da for MS2 peaks.
MS2 spectra (filtered at 1% FDR) of sumoylated peptides were manually validated and annotated using MaxQuant viewer expert system () based on following criteria: (a) good coverage of y-and b-ion series, (b) extensive identification rate of intensive fragment ion peaks, (c) mass error less than 2 ppm after mass recalibration or 4 ppm in case of unsuccessful recalibration, and (d) preferential fragmentation N-terminally to proline or C-terminally to Glu and Asp residues. All peptides identified from the reverse decoy database were removed and the probability of site localization was checked to be greater than 75%. Existence of a diagnostic peak corresponding to a fragment ion of diGly residue (GG+, m/z +115.0505 Th) or presence of an ion series with a neutral loss corresponding to single Gly (m/z 57.0215 Th) or an identification of various modified peptides corresponding to the same sumoylation site contributed to the confidence in assigned sumoylation sites. Finally, all accepted modified peptides corresponding to more than one protein were merged into one site identifier indicated in table S1. To investigate experimental reproducibility a SUMO site was considered “identified” if it matched a peptide from the first list of 1,002 modified peptides.
In vitro SUMO conjugation, deconjugation and processing assays
Recombinant substrate proteins used in these assays have been decribed previously (). All reactions were buffered in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. SUMO2 pro-form processing assays contained 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 600 M SUMO, and 100 nM SENP1 or 200 nM SENP2 recombinant catalytic domains (), and reactions were incubated at 20 °C for 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 or 960 minutes. Conjugation assays contained 5 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 110 nM SAE1 and SAE2, between 0.5 and 2 M Ubc9, ~10 M substrate protein, and a range of SUMO2 concentrations (0, 40, 80, or 200 M) and were incubated at 37 °C for 4 hours. Deconjugation assays were prepared as above using 200 M SUMO followed by addition of SENP1 to 10 nM and reactions monitored at 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 minutes at 20 °C.
Immunoblot analysis
HEK293 N3S cells either stably expressing or not 6His-SUMO2T90K were grown on 75 cm2 flasks in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1 μg/ml puromycin (where required), and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Where indicated heat shock treatment at 43 °C for 30 minutes was applied. Cells were washed twice with 1x DPBS and lysed in protein sample buffer. Immunoblots were prepared using mouse antibody specific to 6His (Clontech No. 631212) or rabbit antibody specific to SUMO2 (Zymed, 91-5100).
TAP-SUMO2 sample preparation and MS analysis
TAP-SUMO2 protein samples remaining from a previous study () were fractionated by protein electrophoresis and the gel was cut into nine slices, trypsinized, and the tryptic peptides were extracted, as described previously (). Peptide mixtures were analysed by MS as described with the following alterations: HPLC fractionation occurred over a linear 115 minute fractionation containing a gradient from 15-32% acetonitrile, with a loop count of 3, an m/z precursor scan range of 800-1800, +3 to +7 inclusion charge range, 5x105 AGC target or 500 ms maximum injection time and 35,000 at 400 m/z resolution for MS2 scans.
Virtual branched peptide database
Virtual branched peptide databases were created as a modification of the procedure described in Matic et al. (11). A python script was created to extract protein sequence information for each SUMO modified protein and then determine the tryptic peptide encompassing each SUMO target lysine. Cleavages at KP and RP were ignored, and protein N-terminal methionines were omitted. Each tryptic peptide was appended at the N-terminus with either the tryptic fragement SUMO1 C-terminus (IADNHTPKELGMEEEDVIEVYQEQTGG) or that of SUMO2 C-terminus (FRFDGQPINETDTPAQLEMEDEDTIDVFQQQTGG), which include a single missed cleavage in this region of SUMO. Raw data files were searched against the databases (SUMO1.fasta, SUMO2.fasta) using MaxQuant version 1.3.0.5 (). Maximum peptide size was set to 10,000 Da. A whole human proteome database was used for first search and the branched peptide database(s) used for main search. Missed cleavages were set to at least 3 and no FDR filtering was used at the protein or peptide level. All spectra were computationally () and manually validated.
Bioinformatics analysis
Sequence analysis was performed using pLogo (). As not all identified peptides could be assigned to a single protein, multiple 13 amino acid sequences were used for input in these cases. N- or C-terminal sequences that did not cover the 13 residue window were omitted from the output. Residues were scaled relative to their Bonferroni-corrected statistical significance using human proteome as a background data set (645,531 lysines). Protein functional annotation and network analysis was created using Ingenuity pathway analysis (Ingenuity Systems, QIAGEN, Redwood City, CA)
