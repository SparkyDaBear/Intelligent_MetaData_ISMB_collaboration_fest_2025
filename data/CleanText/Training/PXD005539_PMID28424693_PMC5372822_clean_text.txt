ABSTRACT:
Evolution of melanoma from a primary tumor to widespread metastasis is crucially dependent on lymphatic spread. The mechanisms regulating the initial step in metastatic dissemination via regional lymph nodes remain largely unknown; however, evidence supporting the establishment of a pre-metastatic niche is evolving. We have previously described a dysfunctional immune profile including reduced expression of dendritic cell (DC) maturation markers in the first node draining from the primary tumor, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Importantly, this phenotype is present prior to evidence of nodal metastasis. Herein, we evaluate melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as potential mediators of the premetastatic niche through cargo-specific polarization of DCs. DCs matured in vitro in the presence of melanoma EVs demonstrated significantly impaired expression of CD83 and CD86 as well as decreased expression of Th1 polarizing chemokines Flt3L and IL15 and migration chemokines MIP-1α and MIP-1β compared to liposome-treated DCs. Profiling of melanoma EV cargo identified shared proteomic and RNA signatures including S100A8 and S100A9 protein cargo, which in vitro compromised DC maturation similar to melanoma EVs. Early evidence demonstrates that similar EVs can be isolated from human afferent lymphatic fluid ex vivo. Taken together, here, we propose melanoma EV cargo as a mechanism by which DC maturation is compromised warranting further study to consider this as a potential mechanism enabled by the primary tumor to establish the premetastatic niche in tumor-draining SLNs of patients.
METHODS:
Materials and Methods
Patient Samples
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating in the following studies, following study approval by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.
Peripheral Blood
Peripheral blood from anonymous healthy donors was collected as clinical residual and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated by Ficoll gradient.
Lymph Node Tissue
Fresh lymphatic tissue was collected as previously described. Briefly, lymph node specimens and proximal afferent lymphatic channels were obtained from patients with melanoma undergoing lymphatic mapping and SLNB as a standard of care (melanoma cohort). Control lymph nodes were obtained from women undergoing prophylactic mastectomy with no evidence of cancer (healthy control cohort). Following lymph node collection and initial pathology review, two non-contiguous 1-mm shavings were submitted for this research study, and the remainder of the frozen tissue was reviewed per routine clinical practice. Intact and clamped afferent lymphatic channels were dissected from the SLN following SLNB in the melanoma cohort. Research specimens were transported in RPMI media and lymph nodes processed into a single-cell suspension using Miltenyi gentleMACs Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
CyTOF Analysis of SLNs
Briefly, single-cell suspensions of fresh SLN tissue was cultured overnight at 37°C in RPMI media (Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS (Millipore) and 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine (PSG) in the presence of 20 IU/mL IL-2 (Prometheus). Following incubation, cells were labeled with viability cisplatin (Cell-ID, Fluidigm) for dead cell exclusion and washed in MaxPar cell staining buffer (Fluidigm). Cells were subsequently fixed in 1.6% paraformaldehyde, blocked with anti-Fc receptor antibodies, and labeled with antibodies to cell surface markers including CD11a (142Nd), ICOS (143Nd), CD8a (146Nd), CD11c (147Sm), PDL1 (148Nd), HLA-DR/DP (150Nd), CD123 (151Eu), Tim-3 (153Eu), CD3 (154Sm), CD86 (156Gd), CCR7 (159Tb), CD14 (160Gd), CD80 (162Dy), Lag-3 (165Ho), CD25 (168 Tm), CTLA-4 (170Er), CD20 (171Yb), CD4 (174Yb), PD-1 (175Lu), CD56 (176Yb), and CD16 (209Bi). Following 30-min incubation with metal-conjugated antibodies, cells were washed and permeabilized in methanol prior to intracellular staining with T-bet (161Dy), Galectin-9 (163Dy), GATA3 (167Er), and Granzyme B (173Yb). After 30-min incubation, cells were again washed and labeled with intercalation solution (Iridium) for resolution of single-cell events. Stained cells were washed, resuspended in water containing calibration beads, and analyzed by CyTOF instrument (Fluidigm). High-dimensional single-cell analysis was conducted by viSNE analysis (Cytobank) sampling 25,000 cellular events/SLN using clustering channels CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD56, CD14, and HLA-DR.
Cell Lines
Human melanoma cell lines SKMEL28 (HTB-72), A375 (CRL-1619), and C32TG (CRL-1579), and normal, primary adult epidermal melanocytes (PCS-200-013) were purchased directly from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and all cell lines were passaged fewer than 10 times prior to storage to preserve authenticity. SKMEL28 and C32TG cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Media supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids and A375 cells cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Corning). All melanoma cell lines were additionally supplemented with 10% exosome-free FBS (Systems Bioscience) and 1% PSG (Corning) and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2. Primary epidermal melanocytes were cultured with dermal cell basal medium supplemented with adult melanocyte growth kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ATCC). Routine screening of Mycoplasma contamination was conducted with MycoProbe Mycoplasma Detection Assay (R&D Systems) most recently in September 2016. All cell lines measured with negative OD values of <0.05.
Hypoxic Cell Culture
For hypoxia induction, Petaka G3 low oxygen transfer flasks (Neuromics) were used to culture melanoma cell lines or primary melanocytes for 48–96 h at 37°C until >80% confluent.
EV Isolation and Quantification
For EV quantification and coculture experiments, EVs were isolated from cell culture supernatant using Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (reagent isolation). For RNA characterization, recombinant protein experiments, and electron microscopy (EM) visualization, conditioned media or lymphatic fluid was prefiltered with a 0.8-µm Minisart NML syringe filter (Sartorius), and EVs were isolated on membrane-affinity spin columns by exoEasy maxi kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (column isolation). Unloaded liposomes (Sigma) were resuspended and sonicated for 30 s to be of similar size distribution and concentration for use as a negative control. To quantify total particle concentration and size distribution, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was performed with NanoSight NS300 (Malvern, UK). Vesicle preparations were diluted 1:100 (reagent isolation) or 1:1000 (column isolation) in HPLC-grade water and loaded into the sample chamber with sterile 1-mL syringe and visualized with NTA 2.3 software. Three video captures of 30 s each were taken of each vesicle preparation and particle concentration and size distribution calculated utilizing manual shutter and gain adjustments. Following analysis by the software, vesicle size was reported as mean particle size ± SEM and particle concentration as total concentration ± SEM.
Immunogold Labeling and Negative Staining
Isolated EVs were concentrated by ultrafiltration on 100-K filters (Millipore), adhered to carbon-coated 200 mesh Cu grids, and labeled with CD63 antibody (BD Biosciences). Grids were incubated with secondary 10 nm gold-conjugated antibody with matching isotypes. Following a wash in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, grids were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde + 1% glutaraldehyde and negative stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid. Micrographs were acquired using a JEOL1400 Plus transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV (Peabody, MA, USA).
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Segments of lymphatic channel (2–4 mm in length) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Following fixation, channels were processed with the use of a laboratory microwave oven (Pelco BioWave 3450, Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA, USA). Briefly, tissue was secondarily fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and embedded into Embed 812 resin. Following a 24-h polymerization at 60°C, 0.1-µm ultrathin sections were poststained with lead citrate. Micrographs were acquired using a JEOL1400 Plus transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV (Peabody, MA, USA).
In Vitro DC Culture
CD14+ monocytes were negatively selected (Miltenyi Biotech) from the PBMCs of healthy human donors. Monocytes were cultured with 10 ng/mL GM-CSF (Genzyme) and 1 ng/mL IL-4 (R&D Systems) for 5 days and matured with 100 ng/mL CD40L (R&D Systems) for 2 days. Differentiating monocytes were cocultured with SKMEL28-derived EVs or liposomes (1 × 1010 particles/mL) from day 0, or recombinant proteins S100A8 (Abcam), S100A9 (ThermoFischer), Annexin A1 (R&D Systems), and/or ICAM1 (R&D Systems) at 10 µg/mL from day 5.
Flow Cytometry and ImageStream
Dendritic cell surface markers were assessed by flow cytometry on Day 7 using surface markers CD14, CD11c, CD123, HLA-DR, HLA-ABC, CD83, AND CD86 (BD Pharmingen). Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed t-tests (p < 0.05). For imaging flow cytometry, prior to coculture with DCs, melanoma-derived EVs were isolated and fluorescently stained with general lipid membrane marker PKH67 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2 µL of PKH was diluted in 0.5 mL Diluent C and then mixed with EV preparation for 4 min. Following the incubation, 1 mL complete culture media was added, and EVs were washed and concentrated over 100-K ultrafilters (Millipore). After 7-day coculture, DCs were analyzed using ImageStream MKII imaging flow cytometer (Amnis) and analyzed using Ideas 6.2 software (Amnis).
Cytokine and Chemokine Multiplex
Cytokine and chemokine protein concentrations were measured in cell culture supernatants using the MagPlex Milliplex human 38-analyte multiplex panel (Millipore) per the manufacturer’s instructions and as described. The analytes measured include EGF, FGF-2, eotaxin, TGF-α, G-CSF, Flt3L, GM-CSF, fractalkine, IFNα2, IFN-γ, GRO, IL-10, MCP-3, IL-12p40, MCD, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, sCD40L, IL-17A, IL-1RA, IL-1α, IL-9, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TNF-α, TNF-β, and VEGF. Assay was read by Luminex xPONENT technology (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA). Analyte concentrations were quantified using a standard curve with a range of 1.6 and 5,000 pg/mL, using Milliplex Analyst software (VigeneTech, Carlisle, MA, USA). All samples were run in duplicate and averaged to determine concentration.
EV Proteomics
Extracellular vesicles were cultured under hypoxic and reduced serum conditions. For hypoxia induction, Petaka G3 low oxygen transfer flasks (Neuromics) were used to culture melanoma cell lines for 48 h at 37°C until >80% confluent. Purified EVs were then lysed, and protein content was measured by BCA assay and run on 4–20% TGX Ready gel (Bo-Rad). Protein bands were visualized by silver stain technique, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). Silver-stained gel sections were prepared for MS analysis as previously described. Briefly, gel fractions were destained in 15 mM potassium ferricyanide:50 mM sodium dithionite:H2O solution, reduced, and alkylated with 50 mM TCEP and 20 mM idoacetamide for 2 h in the dark. Acetonitrile-dehydrated gel sections were digested in 5 ng/µL trypsin overnight at 37°C. Peptides were then extracted in 2% TFA followed by acetonitrile, and both extract solutions combined, dried, and stored at −80°C. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted on either a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Elite Hybrid Mass Spectrometer or QExactivePlus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) both coupled to a Thermo Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC systems, using handpacked Magic C18 3 μm: 25 cm × 75-μm columns at ambient temperatures and Magic C18 5 μm trap at a flow rate of 325 nL/min. The Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer experiment was set to perform a FT full scan from 340–1,500 m/z with resolution set at 120,000 (at 400 m/z), followed by linear ion trap rapid CID MS/MS scans on the top 25 ions. The QExactivePlus experiment performed a FT full scan from 340–1,500 m/z with resolution at 70,000 and HCD on the 20 ions at 17,500. Tandem mass spectra were extracted by MSConvert, and all MS/MS samples were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.4.0) and X! Tandem (The GPM, ; version X! Tandem Sledgehammer (2013.09.01.1)) set up to search the Swissprot all species database (Nov2014, 1,093,672 entries) with reverse decoy sequences. Both searches assumed the digestion enzyme trypsin and a parent ion tolerance of 10.0 PPM with fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.60 Da for the Elite or 0.02 Da for the QXactive Plus raw files. Oxidation of methionine and the iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine were specified as variable modifications. Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.6.2, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm or the Peptide Prophet algorithm and contained at least two identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD005539. Protein identifications matched across all three melanoma cell line EV preparations (SKMEL28, C32TG, A375) were reported, as well as EV specific proteins and intracellular proteins present in non-EV cellular compartments for EV characterization.
Real-time RT-PCR
Isolated EVs were eluted from column with QIAzol lysis buffer and RNA isolated by exoRNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA content was quantified by spectrophotometer DS-11 (DeNovix), and equal concentrations of each EV RNA preparation were then converted to cDNA with RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen). The cDNA was mixed with RT2 SYBR Green Mastermix before loading in a 96-well array containing genes specific to the Th1 and Th2 pathways (Qiagen). The reactions were read by real-time cycler (ABI ViiA7), and fold regulation was calculated for each gene using RT2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software.
