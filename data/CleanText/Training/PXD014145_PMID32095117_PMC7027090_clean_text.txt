ABSTRACT:
Background
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. Over the past 15 years no major improvement of survival rates could be accomplished. The recently discovered histone methyltransferase KMT9 that acts as epigenetic regulator of prostate tumor growth has now raised hopes of enabling new cancer therapies. In this study, we aimed to identify the function of KMT9 in lung cancer.
Methods
We unraveled the KMT9 transcriptome and proteome in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells using RNA-Seq and mass spectrometry and linked them with functional cell culture, real-time proliferation and flow cytometry assays.
Results
We show that KMT9α and -β subunits of KMT9 are expressed in lung cancer tissue and cell lines. Importantly, high levels of KMT9α correlate with poor patient survival. We identified 460 genes that are deregulated at the RNA and protein level upon knock-down of KMT9α in A549 cells. These genes cluster with proliferation, cell cycle and cell death gene sets as well as with subcellular organelles in gene ontology analysis. Knock-down of KMT9α inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation and induces non-apoptotic cell death in A549 cells.
Conclusions
The novel histone methyltransferase KMT9 is crucial for proliferation and survival of lung cancer cells harboring various mutations. Small molecule inhibitors targeting KMT9 therefore should be further examined as potential milestones in modern epigenetic lung cancer therapy.

A549 and PC-9 cells were cultured in DMEM. NCI-H2087 and NCI-H82 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640. GLC-2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol. IMR-90 and CRL-7000 cells were cultured in EMEM. All media were supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, plasmocin and glutamine. Cells were cultured in plasmocin containing medium at all times and are mycoplasma-free. IMR-90 cells were obtained from ATCC. The other cell lines were kind gifts from research groups as follows: NCI-H82 from M. Burger, Freiburg; GLC-2 from R. Büttner, Bonn; A549 from M. Witzenrath, Berlin; PC-9 from L.C. Heukamp, Köln; NCI-H2087 from S. Wöhrle, Boehringer-Ingelheim. Certificates of cell line authentication are provided as Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Transfection with siRNA
Cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs in presence of DharmaFECT 1 (A549; Dharmacon) or RNAiMAX (GLC-2, PC-9, NCI-H2087; Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer`s instruction with a final siRNA concentration of 65 nM (DharmaFECT 1) or 50 nM (RNAiMAX). The sequences of the siRNAs (Stealth RNAi™ siRNAs; Life Technologies) used in the experiments are as following: siControl: 5′-GAAAGUCCUAGAUCCACACGCAAAU-3′; siKMT9α#1: 5′-ACGCUGUAACAAAGUUCACAUUCAA-3′; siKMT9α#2: 5′-CACGCUGUAACAAAGUUCACAUUCA-3′.
Western blot analysis
Experiments were performed as previously described. If not declared otherwise, 3 days before harvesting, cells were transfected with siRNA as indicated. The following antibodies were used: anti-KMT9α (#27630, lot 20062017, Schüle Lab), anti-KMT9β (#28358, lot 27022018, Schüle Lab), anti-H4K12me1 (#27429, lot 27062017, Schüle Lab); anti-H4 (ab31830, lot GR3204774-2, abcam); anti-Tubulin (alpha tubulin, #T6074, lot 03714804 V, Sigma), anti-LMNA (sc-20680, lot F2607, Santa Cruz); anti-GAPDH (MAB574, lot 3273148, R&D systems); anti-SMARCA2 (NB100-55308; lot A1; Novus biologicals); anti-TIMP2 (CST#5738, lot 3, Cell signaling); anti-SOD2 (CST#13194, lot 1, Cell signaling); anti-YES1 (#PA5-80243, lot VA2919193, Invitrogen). Proteins from patient tissues were extracted using the Minilys homogenizer (Bertin instruments) and RIPA buffer (1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris–HCL pH7.5, SDS 0.1%, NaCl 150 mM, NP-40 1%, Na deoxycholate 1%, protease inhibitor cocktail EDTA-free). Samples were cycled for 15 s at top speed.
Cellular fractionation
For cellular fractionation, a modified REAP protocol was used. Briefly, cell pellets obtained by scraping were washed in PBS and suspended in 0.1% NP-40/PBS, spun down for 10 s, and the supernatant was taken as cytosolic fraction. Pellets of the remaining nuclear fractions were washed with 0.1% NP-40/PBS, suspended in protein lysate buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH8), 170 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 0.2 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, complete protease inhibitor EDTA-free (Roche), phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)), kept on ice for 10 min and sonicated 90 s. Protein concentrations were determined using Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher). 30 µg cytosolic and 150 µg nuclear extract were mixed with SDS-running buffer and denaturized 10 min at 99 °C. The samples were then loaded onto a 15% acrylamide gel for electrophoresis and analyzed by western blotting. Tubulin and Lamin A were used as cytosolic and nuclear marker proteins respectively.
Histone extraction
Cells were harvested by scraping, pelleted and washed once in PBS. Pellets were suspended in 200 µl Triton extraction buffer (0.5% Triton-x-100, 0.02% NaN3, complete protease inhibitor tablet EDTA-free (Roche), PBS) and kept on ice for 10 min while gently vortexing. Then, samples were centrifuged at 4 °C with 400g for 10 min, the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were suspended in 100 µl Triton extraction buffer and centrifuged as before. The pellets were suspended in 50 µl 0.2 N HCl and kept at 4 °C overnight while gently agitating. The samples were then centrifuged as before to extract the histones in the supernatant. Bradford assay (BioRad) was used to determine the concentration of the extracts. 2 µg of histones were mixed with SDS-running buffer and denaturized 10 min at 99 °C. The samples were then loaded onto a 18% acrylamide gel and analyzed by western blotting using 4% BSA in 0.5% PBST for blocking and antibody dilutions.
Cell proliferation assays
Cell proliferation was determined using the xCELLigence RTCA system (Roche) or by counting with Trypan Blue staining using LUNA™ Automated Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems). Real-time recording of cell proliferation with xCELLigence RTCA system was started 24 h after transfection with the indicated siRNAs. For A549 cells 2500 cells/well were seeded in 16 well E-plates (Roche). For GLC-2 15000 cells/well were used. For PC-9 and NCI-H2087 20000 cells/well were used. Cell indices were automatically recorded every 15 min. For Trypan Blue proliferation assay 5 × 104 cells/well (siControl) or 1 × 105 cells/well (siKMT9α#1) were seeded onto 6-well plates 24 h after treatment with siRNA. After 48 h, 72 h and 96 h, supernatant, PBS from washing step and adherent cells harvested by trypsinization were counted and analyzed for viability using Trypan Blue staining and LUNA™ Automated Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems). Population doubling time was calculated from 0 to 72 h (logarithmic growth) using Roth V. 2006 Doubling Time Computing.
Flow cytometry for detection of apoptosis, cell cycle and granularity
For apoptosis and cell cycle analysis, cells were trypsinized 24 h after treatment with siRNA and plated onto 6-well plates. One fraction was analyzed directly (day 1) and two more on day 2 and day 3. For apoptosis analysis cells were after trypsinization, washed in flow cytometry buffer (2% FCS, 2 mM EDTA, PBS) and stained with Annexin V-FITC in binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature. 7-AAD was added 10 min prior to analysis. Reagents were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Biolegend, Apoptosis Detection Kit). Cells double positive for Annexin V and PI were considered apoptotic. Cell cycle phase distribution was measured via DNA staining by propidium iodide (PI). To this end, trypsinized cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in 100 µl PBS, fixed by adding 1 ml ice-cold 70% ethanol dropwise while vortexing and kept at − 20 °C for at least 2 h prior to two wash steps in PBS (centrifuged with 500g, 3 min at room temperature). Staining was performed in 100 µl PBS with 100 μg/ml RNAse A (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml PI (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were analyzed by recording at least 10,000 events and gated in PI-Area versus PI-Width channels. Cell cycle phase proportions were calculated by FlowJo 10.4 software. Cell granularity was measured at day 4 after transfection. In side scatter (SSC) versus forward scatter (FSC) contour plots (10% level) of living single cells a gate “high granularity” was drawn just above the main population of cells treated with siControl and transferred to the cells treated with siKMT9α to quantify population shift in SSC. Flow cytometry was done using BD LSR-Fortessa Cell Analyzer and data were analyzed with FlowJo software.
RNA isolation
Three days after transfection with siRNA as indicated, cells were harvested by scraping, washed in PBS and resuspended in 500 µl TRIzol. Upon addition of 300 µl chloroform samples were vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged 15 min at 4 °C with full speed. Then, the upper phase was transferred into a new tube containing 500 µl isopropanol. The samples were vortexed 10 s, incubated for 1 h at room temperature and centrifuged as before. Upon removal of the supernatants pellets were sequentially washed with 100% ethanol, followed by 75% ethanol in DEPC-treated H2O and allowed to air dry (approximately 30 min). Finally, pellets were resuspended in 15 µl DEPC-H2O and incubated for 10 min at 55 °C. RNA concentration was measured by Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher).
RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)
RNA samples were sequenced by the standard Illumina protocol to create raw sequence files (.fastq files) at the sequencing core facility of the DKFZ, Heidelberg. Reads were aligned to the hg19 build of the human genome using STAR version 2.5. The aligned reads were counted with the homer software (analyzeRepeats) and differentially expressed genes were identified using EdgeR. P value < 1 * 10−8 and log2(fold-change) > 0.26 or log2(fold-change) < (− 0.26) were considered statistically significant. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the Broad Institute software, false discovery rate < 10−5. Data are deposited under GSE131016.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Abgene SYBR Green PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the supplier’s protocol. POLR2A was used for normalization. Primers for KMT9α, YES1, SOD2, TIMP2 and SMARCA2 were as follows: KMT9α (5′-ACGTTTCTGCTTTTGGACGC-3′, 5′-TCAGTGCACATGTACAAAGCC-3′); YES1 (5′-CGCCTGCAGATTCCATTCAG-3′, 5′-GTCACCCCTTATCTCATCCCA-3′); SOD2 (5′-TTTCAATAAGGAACGGGGACAC-3′, 5′-GTGCTCCCACACATCAATCC-3′); TIMP2 (5′-AAGCGGTCAGTGAGAAGGAAG-3′, 5′-GGGGCCGTGTAGATAAACTCTAT-3′); SMARCA2 (5′-GAAGCACCCAAAGCAAGTCA-3′, 5′-TTCTCTTCGGTTTCCTGCCT-3′).
Proteomic sample preparation
A549 cells transfected with siControl or siKMT9α#1 (n = 4) were harvested 3 days after transfection. To ensure complete removal of cell culture media the cells were washed twice with 1 ml PBS each time followed by centrifugation at 800g. Cell pellets were lysed using 300 µl lysis buffer for 10 min at 95 °C and 750 rpm. The lysis buffer contained 0.1% RapiGest SF (Waters, Milford, MA), 0.1 M HEPES pH 8.0 (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) and protease inhibitors: 10 µM trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido (4-guanidino)butane (E-64), 10 µM E64d, 10 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Samples were additionally sonicated using 20 cycles (30 s ON/OFF) at 4 °C in a Bioruptor device (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium). Afterwards, the protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific) and 100 µg of protein from each sample was transferred to a fresh tube. Protein reduction was performed using 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany, 15 min at 37 °C, 750 rpm agitation). Free thiols were alkylated by 15 mM 2-iodoacetamide (IAM) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark without mixing. Tryptic in-solution digestion was performed by adding sequencing grade trypsin (Worthington, 1:25 enzyme:protein ratio) to each sample and incubating at 50 °C for 2 h at 750 rpm agitation followed by a second digestion step at 37 °C, 18 h at 500 rpm. Samples were then acidified by adding trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 2% and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to degrade the acid-labile surfactant RapiGestSF. All samples were desalted using iST columns according to the manufacturers protocol (PreOmics, Martinsried, Germany). The peptide concentration was measured using BCA and 25 µg of each sample was transferred to a fresh microreaction tube and vacuum-concentrated until dryness. Samples were resuspended in 50 µl 0.1 M HEPES pH 8.0. For internal quantification control the samples were divided in two groups and different amounts (600 fmol vs. 1000 fmol) of 11 synthetic peptides were spiked-in. Samples including the synthetic peptides were labeled using TMT-10-plex (Thermo Scientific) at room temperature overnight with 550 rpm agitation. All samples were combined and 45 µg of the mixture were fractionated by high pH reversed phase chromatography [XBridge C18 column, 150 mm × 1 mm column containing 3.5 µm particles (Waters)]. An increasing linear gradient of acetonitrile from 10 to 45% over 45 min at a flowrate of 42 µl/min was applied using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. 24 fractions were collected and concatenated into 12 fractions (combining fraction 1 with fraction 13, fraction 2 with fraction 14 and so on). The resulting 12 fractions were vacuum-concentrated until dryness and stored at − 80 °C until LC–MS/MS analysis.
Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry
Each fraction was dissolved in 40 µl buffer A containing 0.1% formic acid in water (Honeywell) and sonicated for 5 min in a sonication water bath. Samples were separated using an EASY-nLC™ 1000 UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Prior to the separation, the injected sample (6 µl per fraction) was trapped on a PepMAP100 C18 nanoViper trapping column (20 mm × 75 µm, 3 µm particles). The analytical column was an EASY-Spray™ C18 column (250 mm × 75 µm, 2 µm particles heated at 50 °C). For peptide separation, we used a linear gradient of increasing buffer B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, Fluka), ranging from 5 to 25% acetonitrile over the first 60 min and from 25 to 60% acetonitrile in the subsequent 30 min (90 min separating gradient length). Peptides were analyzed using a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) operating in a data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Survey scans were performed at 70,000 resolution, an AGC target of 3e6 and a maximum Injection time of 50 ms followed by targeting the top 10 precursor ions for fragmentation scans at 35,000 resolution with 1.2 m/z isolation windows, an NCE of 32 and an dynamic exclusion time of 40 s. For all ms2 scans the intensity threshold was set to 1000, the AGC to 1e5, maximum Injection time of 100 ms and the fixed first mass to 100 m/z. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD014145.
Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry data analysis
Raw data were analyzed using MaxQuant (v 1.6.0.2) and a human proteome database (reviewed sequences, downloaded from uniprot.org on June 6th, 2017, containing 20188 entries and 11 additional sequences for the iRT peptides). In MaxQuant the PIF was set to 0.75 and up to two missed cleavages were allowed using the Trypsin/P enzymatic specificity. Protein N-term acetylation and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications whereas carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification. Unique and razor peptides were used for protein quantification, allowing for protein quantification based on only one peptide. The results were further processed using R (v 3.5.2) and RStudio (v 1.1.456). First all contaminants, reverse hits and spiked-in peptides were removed as well as proteins which were only identified by site. Subsequently, protein intensities were log2 transformed and normalized across all samples using median polish. To identify differentially expressed proteins, we used the limma package (v 3.40.0). Only proteins with an adjusted P-value < 0.05 were considered as being significantly dysregulated. Those proteins were then combined with the genes found significantly dysregulated in the RNA-Seq experiments resulting in a comprehensive dataset containing transcriptome and proteome information.
Data analysis
TCGA data was accessed and analyzed by using UALCAN. The t test was performed using a PERL script with Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) module “Statistics::TTest”. Survival data of GSE26939 data set was obtained and analyzed using PROGgeneV2 program. Briefly, hazard ratio and confidence interval were determined by cox proportional hazards analysis using ‘coxph’ function in R library ‘survival’, the Kaplan–Meier plot was created using ‘surfit’ function in R library ‘survival’. Prism 6 was used for statistical calculations. Data are presented as means ± standard deviation or means + standard deviation. Significance was calculated by two-tailed paired t test.
