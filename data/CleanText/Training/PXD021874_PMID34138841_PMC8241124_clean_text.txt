ABSTRACT:
Glycosylation is one of the most complex posttranslational protein modifications. Its importance has been established not only for eukaryotes but also for a variety of prokaryotic cellular processes, such as biofilm formation, motility, and mating. However, comprehensive glycoproteomic analyses are largely missing in prokaryotes. Here, we extend the phenotypic characterization of N-glycosylation pathway mutants in Haloferax volcanii and provide a detailed glycoproteome for this model archaeon through the mass spectrometric analysis of intact glycopeptides. Using in-depth glycoproteomic datasets generated for the wild-type (WT) and mutant strains as well as a reanalysis of datasets within the Archaeal Proteome Project (ArcPP), we identify the largest archaeal glycoproteome described so far. We further show that different N-glycosylation pathways can modify the same glycosites under the same culture conditions. The extent and complexity of the Hfx. volcanii N-glycoproteome revealed here provide new insights into the roles of N-glycosylation in archaeal cell biology.
A comprehensive glycoproteomic analysis of Haloferax volcanii reveals the extent and complexity of glycosylation in archaea and provides new insights into the roles of this post-translational modification in various cellular processes, including cell shape determination.

Materials and methods
Strains and growth conditions
Hfx. volcanii H53, as well as the ΔaglB and Δagl15 mutants, was grown at 45°C in liquid or on solid agar semi-defined casamino acid (Hv-Cab) medium. H53 cultures were supplemented with tryptophan (+Trp) and uracil (+Ura) at a final concentration of 50 μg ml−1. The generation of the ΔaglB and Δagl15 strains from the background strain H53 (ΔpyrE2; ΔtrpA) was described previously, and both strains were obtained from the Eichler laboratory. Each mutant carried a trpA insertion in the respective gene and was therefore grown on Hv-Cab +Ura.
For direct comparison of colony morphology and motility phenotypes, all strains were grown on Hv-Cab +Trp +Ura, but phenotypes of deletion mutants were confirmed on Hv-Cab +Ura. Colony morphology was imaged after 5 days of incubation at 45°C using a Nikon D3500 DX.
Motility assay
Motility assays were performed as described previously using Hv-Cab media containing 0.35% agar supplemented with Ura and Trp as required for the analyzed strain. Halos around the stab-inoculation site were imaged after 5 days of incubation at 45°C using a Nikon D3500 DX.
Growth curve
Liquid Hv-Cab starting cultures (5 mL) were inoculated from single colonies and grown at 45°C under shaking (250 rpm). After reaching an OD600 of 0.3 to 0.5 (measured in the culture tube, path length approximately 1.5 cm), all cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 in 20 mL to obtain comparable conditions at the start of the growth curve. Subsequently, OD600 was monitored for 74 hours; these measurements were performed by pipetting 250 μL of culture into a 96-well plate and measuring the absorption with a Biotek PowerWaveX2 microplate spectrophotometer. When cultures reached an OD above 0.75, samples were diluted 1:5 before measurement.
Cell shape assessment
Liquid Hv-Cab (5 mL) was inoculated with single colonies and grown at 45°C under shaking (250 rpm). At early-logarithmic (OD600 of 0.03 to 0.05), mid-logarithmic (OD600 of 0.35 to 0.5), and late-logarithmic (OD600 of 1.6 to 2.0) growth phase, 1 mL of culture was centrifuged (5 minutes, 6,000 g) and resuspended in 20 μL of medium (for early-logarithmic phase, correspondingly higher volumes were used for higher ODs). Resuspended cells were observed on a Leica DMi8 microscope at 100× magnification using differential inference microscopy (DIC). Images were taken with a Leica DFC9000GT camera attached to the microscope.
For quantitative cell shape analyses, images were taken in brightfield instead of DIC mode and processed with CellProfiler (version 4.1.3). Cells were identified using the IdentifyPrimaryObjects and IdentifySecondaryObjects (propagation method) functions with a typical object diameter of 15 to 50 pixels, robust background thresholding, and a lower threshold bound of 0.83. After combining primary and secondary objects and merging touching objects, the MeasureObjectSizeShape function was employed to determine the eccentricity of cells, with 0 corresponding to a circle and 1 corresponding to a line shape. For each strain and biological replicate, 2 representative images were analyzed, corresponding to 300 to 750 cells for strain and condition. For each condition and strain combination, a t test was performed, testing for equal means and assuming unequal variances. Resulting p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.
Cell fractionation
A 5-mL Hv-Cab starting culture (inoculated from single colonies for biological replicates) was grown at 45°C under shaking (250 rpm) until it reached an OD600 of 0.3 to 0.5 (measured in the culture tube, path length approximately 1.5 cm). The culture was then diluted to 25 mL (OD600 of 0.01) and was kept growing under the same conditions. Once the culture reached an OD600 of 0.3, a 10-mL sample was taken, while the remaining culture continued growing for another 24 hours, reaching early stationary phase (OD600 > 1.7), at which point a second 10-mL sample was taken. Each sample was processed as follows immediately after it has been taken.
The culture was centrifuged at 6,000 g for 10 minutes to separate the cells from the SN. The SN fraction was transferred into new tubes and centrifuged again 2 more times, once at 10,000 g for 10 minutes and once at 16,000 g for 20 minutes, to remove contaminating cells and potential large cell debris. Afterwards, the SNs from both samples (mid-logarithmic and early-stationary growth phase) were combined and concentrated to approximately 150 μL in centrifugal filter units with a 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters, 0.5 ml, Millipore, centrifugation at 14,000 g).
The cell pellets from step (i) of both samples were resuspended and combined in 1-mL PBS (2.14 M NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 10.14 mM Na2HPO4, 1.76 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 10 mM EDTA as well as 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed by freezing (−80°C) and thawing (on ice) them 3 times. Cellular DNA was digested by adding 10 μg of DNAse I and incubating the mixture at 37°C for 30 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 minutes at 4°C to pellet unlysed cells. Subsequently, the SN was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 300,000 g and 4°C in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The SN of this step was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again (using the same settings) to remove potential membrane contaminations. The resulting SN corresponds to the Cyt fraction.
The pellet after the first ultracentrifugation step was washed in 600 μL of ice-cold PBS and centrifuged again using the same settings. After carefully removing the SN, the pellet representing the Mem fraction was resuspended in 300 μL 100 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2% SDS.
Each cellular fraction was transferred to centrifugal filter units with a 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff, washed 3 times with 400 μL H2O, followed by a protein solubilization step with 400 μL 100 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2% SDS, incubation at 55°C for 15 minutes, and 2 additional washes with 400 μL H2O. Afterwards, the protein concentration of each fraction was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA Protein Assay Kit by Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were stored at −80°C until further use.
SDS-PAGE and glycoprotein staining
Protein samples of each fraction (7.5 μg) were mixed with NuPAGE loading buffer and dithiothreitol (DTT, final concentration 50 mM), incubated at 55°C for 15 minutes and then separated by electrophoresis on a 4% to 12% v/v Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (1.5 mm, 10 well) using MOPS SDS running buffer (NuPAGE). Two gels were run in parallel, one of which was stained overnight with Coomassie brilliant blue for protein detection (destaining with H2O), while the other was stained for glycoproteins using the Pro-Q Emerald 300 glycoprotein staining kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. SeeBlue Plus2 prestained protein marker (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for Coomassie-stained gels, whereas CandyCane glycoprotein marker (Invitrogen) was used for Pro-Q Emerald 300 stained gels. In addition, BSA (5 μg, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was loaded as a control, which is not modified by N-glycans but is stained by periodic acid–Schiff staining, potentially due to O-glycosylation. Furthermore, CcmG from Rhodobacter capsulatus, recombinantly expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, was loaded (15 μg, generously provided by Fevzi Daldal and Andreia Verissimo) as a non-glycosylated control. Gels were imaged using an Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). UV light was used to image Pro-Q Emerald 300 stained gels, and exposure times were adjusted to 0.1 seconds to result in minimal signal from the non-glycosylated control.
Mass spectrometric analysis
Protein samples of each fraction (30 μg for Mem and Cyt and 10 μg for SN) were processed and digested using S-Trap mini spin columns (ProtiFi) and following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of solubilization buffer (10% SDS in 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), pH 7.55) and subsequently reduced by adding 20 mM DTT (15 minutes, 55°C) and alkylated by adding 40 mM iodoacetamide (30 minutes, room temperature, dark). After acidifying the solution with phosphoric acid (final concentration 1.2%), S-Trap binding buffer (90% methanol, 100 mM TEAB, pH 7.1) was added at a ratio of 1:7 (sample volume: binding buffer volume). The mixture was loaded onto the S-Trap spin column and centrifuged at 4,000 g for 30 seconds. Captured proteins were washed 3 times with 400 μL S-Trap binding buffer. Proteases were added at a ratio of 1:25 (enzyme weight: sample protein weight) in 125 μL digestion buffer (50 mM TEAB for trypsin; 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 for GluC). Digestion was performed overnight at 37°C. Peptides were eluted in 3 steps: 80 μL H2O, followed by 80 μL 0.2% formic acid, and finally 80 μL 50% acetonitrile (ACN). The spin column was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 60 seconds at each step. Eluted peptides from the different steps were pooled and dried in a vacuum centrifuge.
All samples were desalted using homemade C18 stage-tips (3 M Empore Discs) as previously described, with minor modifications. Briefly, columns were conditioned with 100 μL ACN and equilibrated 2 times with 100 μL 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Samples were resuspended in 0.1% TFA and loaded onto the stage-tip. After washing 3 times with 100 μL 0.1% TFA, peptides were eluted with 2 times 80 μL 0.1% formic acid in 60% ACN and dried in a vacuum centrifuge.
Peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and analyzed with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled via a nanospray source to a Q-Exactive HFX tandem MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in positive ion mode. Approximately 1 μg of peptides were desalted on a trap column (Acclaim PepMap100 C18, 5 μm, 100 Å, 300 μm i.d. × 5 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then separated on an in-house packed column (75 μm i.d. × 25 cm fused silica capillary packed with 3 μm ReproSil-Pur C18 beads (Dr. Maisch)). A 60-minute gradient was used with a flow rate of 400 μL mL−1. Solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN) was increased from 4% to 21% over 40 minutes, followed by an increase to 40% over 20 minutes. Afterwards, to wash and re-equilibrate the column, solvent B was increased to 90% over 2 minutes, kept constant at 90% for 6 minutes, and then decreased to 4% over 2 minutes with subsequent constant flow at 4% for at least 10 minutes.
Data-dependent acquisition was performed, acquiring MS1 spectra over a range of 400 to 2,000 m/z with a resolution of 60,000, an AGC target of 1e6, and a maximum injection time of 100 ms. The top 20 peaks were selected for HCD fragmentation with stepped normalized collision energy (25, 30, and 35 NCE). MS2 spectra were acquired with a fixed first mass (130 m/z), a resolution of 15,000, an AGC target of 1e5, and a maximum injection time of 200 ms. A dynamic exclusion list (10 seconds) was used, and charge states 1 and >6 were excluded. MS raw files generated for this study have been uploaded to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD021874.
Bioinformatic analysis of MS data
The analysis of MS data followed the general workflow established by the ArcPP using the Python framework Ursgal, with modifications as follows. Briefly, MS raw files were converted into mzML files using ThermoRawFileParser, followed by conversion into MGF format by pymzML. Protein database searches were performed against the ArcPP Hfx. volcanii theoretical proteome (4,074 proteins, version 190606, June 6, 2019, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3565631), supplemented with common contaminants, and decoys using shuffled peptide sequences. MSFragger (version 2.3), X!Tandem (version vengeance), and MS-GF+ (version 2019.07.03) were employed as search engines. Search parameters for the reanalysis of ArcPP datasets matched those described previously. For the dataset PXD021874 (generated for this study), a precursor mass tolerance of +/−10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 10 ppm were used, 2 and 3 missed cleavages were allowed for data derived from samples digested with Trypsin and GluC, respectively, and oxidation of M, N-terminal acetylation were included as potential modifications, while carbamidomethylation of C was required as fixed modification. In addition, for all datasets, all known compositions of AglB- and Agl15-dependent N-glycans have been added as potential modifications of N (Table 4). Hex(2) was included as a potential modification of S or T for the search of O-glycopeptides. Since most protein database search engines do not support the search for multiple different modifications of the same amino acid, each N-glycan composition was searched for separately. Unfortunately, this means that we could not assess whether peptides containing 2 N-glycosites could be modified with 1 AglB- and 1 Agl15-dependent glycan.
Results from all cellular fractions of one sample were merged before statistical post-processing with Percolator (version 3.4). Subsequently, results from different search engines and from all searches for different glycan compositions were combined using the combined PEP approach as described before. After removal of PSMs with a combined PEP > 1%, results were sanitized, i.e. for spectra with multiple differing PSMs, only the PSM with the best combined PEP was accepted. Peptide and protein FDRs were calculated as described previously, while treating each peptidoform (peptide + modification) separately and only peptidoforms with an FDR ≤1% and proteins with an FDR ≤0.5% were accepted.
Spectra corresponding to glycopeptide spectrum matches were searched for glycopeptide-specific fragment ions using the glycopeptide_fragmentor node in Ursgal using the glycopeptide ion matching functionality of SugarPy. The fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm, and at least 1 B-ion and 2 Y-ions were required to be found in at least 1 spectrum of each glycopeptide. Finally, glycopeptides were required to be identified in at least 2 replicates (as defined for each dataset).
Prediction of protein subcellular localization and protein domains
Secretion signals and the probable subcellular localization were determined as previously described. Candidates for ArtA processing were taken from. Further protein domains were predicted with InterPro, and arCOGlet categories for each protein were obtained based on the latest release (December 2015).
Phylogenetic analyses
For analysis of phylogenetic distributions, we used OrthoDB v10.1. The locus tag (e.g., HVO_2072 for SLG) was used to interrogate OrthoDB, and groups were extracted at the taxonomic levels Halobacteria, Euryarchaeota, and Archaea (October 2020). At each level, OrthoDB lists the number of species having an ortholog and the number of species analyzed at that level. For each group and level, a FASTA file is provided, and the FASTA files at levels Halobacteria and Archaea were downloaded for a more detailed, script-based analysis. At the level Halobacteria, the analysis was performed at the species level. Four species were represented by 2 strains, and only one of them was considered, leaving a total of 161 species at the level Halobacteria. For the domain Archaea, the analysis was performed at the genus level. OrthoDB codes consist of a species identifier (the NCBI TaxID with a strain serial number) and a protein identifier. For transformation of TaxID to species/genus, the NCBI taxonomy was inquired (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) (accessed October 22, 2020).
For gene synteny analysis, the SyntTax server was used (accessed October 2020). At the time of usage, the server analyzed 94 genomes from the taxonomic class Halobacteria. It should be noted that only the main chromosomes are analyzed within the SyntTax server.
