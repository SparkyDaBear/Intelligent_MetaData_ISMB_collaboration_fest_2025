ABSTRACT:
The heart is a central human organ and its diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, but an in-depth knowledge of the identity and quantity of its constituent proteins is still lacking. Here, we determine the healthy human heart proteome by measuring 16 anatomical regions and three major cardiac cell types by high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics. From low microgram sample amounts, we quantify over 10,700 proteins in this high dynamic range tissue. We combine copy numbers per cell with protein organellar assignments to build a model of the heart proteome at the subcellular level. Analysis of cardiac fibroblasts identifies cellular receptors as potential cell surface markers. Application of our heart map to atrial fibrillation reveals individually distinct mitochondrial dysfunctions. The heart map is available at maxqb.biochem.mpg.de as a resource for future analyses of normal heart function and disease.
The human heart is composed of distinct regions and cell types, but relatively little is known about their specific protein composition. Here, the authors present a region- and cell type-specific proteomic map of the healthy human heart, revealing functional differences and potential cell type markers.

Methods
Tissue preparation
In total, 16 healthy heart regions from three adult male individuals (Supplementary Table 1) were collected less than 72 h postmortem during an autopsy after a court order. The hearts of the subjects did not present any relevant injury or signs of cardiac malfunction and were therefore defined as healthy. The 16 heart regions included four main vessels (aorta (Ao), pulmonary artery (PA), vena cava inferior (IVC), and pulmonary vein (PVe)), four heart cavities (right atrium (RA), left atrium (LA), right ventricle (RV), and left ventricle (LV)), four heart valves (tricuspid valve (TV), pulmonary valve (PV), aortic valve (AV), and mitral valve (MV)), the ventricular septum (SepV), the atrial septum (SepA), the left coronary artery (LCA), and the right coronary artery (RCA) were explanted by an official medicolegal expert. Samples were stored at −80 °C after collection. The investigation was approved by the local ethical committee of the Medical Faculty of the Technical University of Munich (project no. 247/16s). The ethical committee explicitly approved the use of human samples in the context of trauma.
Cell isolation
Atrial samples from patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery were cut into 1–2-mm2 fragments and digested with 2 mg per ml of collagenase type II (Life Technologies, Cat. No. 17101-015, Carlsbad, CA) in PBS (1 h, 37 °C). After filtration (70-µm cell strainer (Greiner Bio-One, Cat. No. 542070, Frickenhausen, Germany) and red cell lysis (Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution, Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130-094-183, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), the remaining cells were resuspended in 1 ml of auto-running MACS buffer (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130-090-221). After preseparation (30-µm filter, Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130-041-407), CD31-positive endothelial cells (ECs) were isolated using the CD31 MicroBead Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. No. 130-091-935) and the human FcR-Blocking Regent (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat.No. 130-059-901) in the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Isolated ECs were cultured in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium 2 (PromoCell, Cat. No. C-22011, Heidelberg, Germany) until confluence. Adipose fibroblasts (AF) were isolated from subcutaneous fat tissue and cardiac fibroblasts (CF) were isolated from atrial samples. Tissues were cut and digested using collagenase solution type II (2.5 h, 37 °C), and resuspended in DMEM high glucose (Biochrom-Millipore, Cat. No. FG 0435; Berlin, Germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany), penicillin (100 U per ml), streptomycin (100 µg per ml), both from PanReacAppliChem (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), and sodium-pyruvate (1 mM, Gibco, Karlsbaden, CA) and grown to confluence. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated from the arteria mammaria interna (ITA). Vessels were cut longitudinally. With a scalpel, the tissue was cut into square pieces. The pieces were put on BD PrimariaTM 6-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) and dried (2–3 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2). Subsequently, SMC growth medium 2 (PromoCell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was added. When the first SMCs migrated from the tissue, the pieces were removed and cells were grown to confluence. All biopsies from patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery were transferred within 10 min from the operation room in PBS. To passage the ECs, SMCs, and fibroblasts, cells were incubated with trypsin (Life Technologies) diluted 1 in 4 in PBS (5 min, 37 °C, 5% CO2). Trypsin solution was neutralized using 2 times of media. ECs and SMCs were frozen in liquid nitrogen in 10% DMSO (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), 40% FCS, and 50% cell-type-specific medium. CFs and AFs were frozen in liquid nitrogen using 10% DMSO and 10% FCS in fibroblast-specific medium as described above. The generation of cell cultures from patient biopsies was approved by the local ethical committee of the Medical Faculty of the Technical University of Munich (project no. 1588/06 (amendment) and 2919/10).
Flow cytometry-based quantification of the cell types
Frozen SMCs isolated from the ITA (passage p2) and cultured as described above were thawed and used for flow cytometry analysis. SMCs were fixed in 1% formaldehyde (20 min) and blocked in PBS containing 10% FCS (v/v) and 0.05% sodium azide (w/v). The first antibody anti-alpha smooth muscle actin (ab5694, Abcam, UK) was added at a ratio of 1:20 in wash/permeabilization buffer (PBS containing 5% FCS (v/v), saponin 0.5% (w/v), and sodium azide (0.05%, w/v)) for 30 min at 4 °C. The secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488® (ab150077, Abcam, UK) was added at a ratio of 1:2000 in buffer containing saponin (30 min, ice, dark). ECs from atrial biopsies were isolated and cultured as described above. After preparation of a single-cell suspension, one sample of the total biopsy and the positive and negative fraction obtained after MACS were analyzed. All cell fractions were resuspended in ice-cold PBS/0.5% BSA/2 mM EDTA (FACS buffer) containing 5% anti-human CD31 PE-Cy7 (25-0319, eBioscience, Frankfurt, Germany) and incubated for 30 min in the dark. CFs and AFs were isolated as described before. Cells were cultured on gelatin-coated plates and analyzed at passage 1 or 2. Cells were detached using 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies) diluted at a ratio of 1:4 in PBS. Monoclonal anti-human CD90 PE-Cy5 (eBioscience, 15-0909), anti-human CD105 APC (eBioscience, 17-1057), and anti-human CD45 FITC (eBioscience, 11-9459) antibodies were resuspended at a ratio of 1:20 in ice-cold FACS buffer and incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark. After staining, all cells undergoing flow cytometry analyses were resuspended in ice-cold PBS/0.5% BSA/4 mM EDTA and kept in the dark on ice until flow cytometric analysis was performed with a BD LSRFortessa (BD, San Jose, CA). Negative controls were unstained or stained with the secondary antibody alone. Cytometry data were analyzed with the FlowJo software version 7.6.5 (flowjo@treestar.com).
Immunocytochemistry
SMCs were fixed (4% PFA, 20 min) and permeabilized in PBS-T (0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS, 10 min). Unspecific binding was blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Abcam, ab7841, Cambridge, UK) in PBST for 30 min. Polyclonal rabbit anti-alpha smooth muscle actin (Abcam, ab5694) was diluted at a ratio of 1:20 in PBS-T and SMCs were incubated with the first antibody overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody goat-anti- rabbit IgG (H&L) Alexa Fluor 555® (Abcam, ab150078) was diluted at a ratio of 1:200 in PBS-T. Cells were incubated in the dark for 60 min. ECs isolated from LA and the positive and the negative fraction after MACS sort were stained for CD31. Cells were isolated and processed using the MACS system as described above and plated on cover slides until confluence. Cells were fixed using 4% PFA (10 min) and blocked (5% goat serum in PBS). Polyclonal rabbit anti-CD31 (Abcam, ab28364) was diluted at a ratio of 1:25 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) Alexa Fluor 555® (Abcam, ab150078) was diluted at a ratio of 1:500 and incubated (60 min, dark). Both antibodies were diluted in PBS. CFs and AFs were fixed using 4% PFA/sucrose in PBS (15 min). For VIM staining, cells were permeabilized (0.25% Triton-X-100 in PBS) and unspecific binding sites were blocked (5% goat serum in PBS-T, 1 h). Polyclonal rabbit anti-VIM (Abcam, ab45939) was used as cytoskeleton marker at 1 µg per ml of final concentration in PBS-T. For DDR2, staining cells were washed with PBS after fixation and blocked with 5% goat-serum in PBS. Polyclonal rabbit anti-DDR2 (LSBio, LS-C99151, Seattle, WA) was diluted at a ratio of 1:20 in PBS. Both antibodies were incubated for 1 h. Secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) Alexa Fluor 555® (Abcam, ab150078) was diluted at a ratio of 1:500 in either PBS-T or PBS and incubated for 1 h in the dark. For immunocytochemistry, SMCs, ECs, CFs, and AFs were grown to approximately 80% confluence on 4-well chamber cover slides (Millizell EZ slides, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). All incubations were performed at room temperature, except overnight incubations. After the last wash, slides were air-dried, mounted in Abcam-mounting medium containing DAPI (Abcam, ab104139), sealed with coverslips, and evaluated under a fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200 M, Zeiss, D-73447 Oberkochen).
RT-qPCR analysis
Expression of CF-specific proteins was confirmed on transcriptional level by RT-qPCR analysis. ECs, SMCs, CFs, and AFs (p0-4) were lysed with RNA lysis buffer (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). Total RNA was purified using the peqGOLD total RNA kit (Peqlab) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Expression of ALDH1A2, PDFD, DAPK1, CSRP2, DIAPH3, CES1, and PTPRZ1 was evaluated on a QuantStudio3 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the following conditions: activation of Taq DNA polymerase (15 min at 95 °C) followed by 40 cycles with 15 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 60 °C. The sequences of the used primers are noted in Supplementary Table 4. Quantification was performed using the relative expression software tool REST©. Data were normalized to β-actin.
Sample preparation for MS analysis
All 16 heart regions dissected from three trauma victims were washed three times with cold PBS before being crushed in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Powdered samples were then resupended in 500 µl of SDC reduction and alkylation buffer and boiled for 10 min to denature proteins. Samples were further mixed (six times for 30 s and cooled on ice in-between) using a FastPrep®-24 Instrument (MP Biomedicals). Protein concentration was measured using the Tryptophan assay and 300 µg were further processed for overnight digestion by adding Lys-C and trypsin in a 1:50 ratio (µg of enzyme to µg of protein) at 37 °C and 1700 rpm. On the following day, samples were sonicated using a bioruptor (15 cycles of 30 s) and further digested for 3 h with Lys-C and trypsin (1:100 ratio). Peptides were acidified to a final concentration of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for SDB-RPS binding and 40 µg of peptides were loaded on four 14-gauge Stage-Tip plugs. Peptides were washed first with isopropanol/1% TFA (200 µl) and then 0.2% TFA (200 µl) using an in-house-made Stage-Tip centrifuge at 2000×g. Peptides were eluted with 60 µl of elution buffer (80% acetonitrile/1% ammonia) into auto sampler vials and dried at 60 °C using a SpeedVac centrifuge (Eppendorf, Concentrator plus). Peptides were resuspended in 2% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA and sonicated (Branson Ultrasonics, Ultrasonics Cleaner Model 2510) before peptide concentration estimation using the Nanodrop. About 30 µg of peptides of each sample were further fractionated into 54 fractions and concatenated into 8 fractions by high-pH reversed-phase fractionation using the recently described “loss-less” nano-fractionator. CFs, AFs, ECs, and SMCs were processed similarly to the heart tissue samples without liquid nitrogen crushing and FastPrep®-24 Instrument.
Liquid chromatography–MS analysis
Nanoflow LC–MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides was conducted on a quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive HF, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) coupled to an EASYnLC 1200 ultra-high-pressure system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) via a nano-electrospray ion source. About 1 µg of peptides were loaded on a 40-cm HPLC-column (75-μm inner diameter; in-house packed using ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9-µm silica beads; Dr Maisch GmbH, Germany). Peptides were separated using a linear gradient from 2 to 20% B in 55 min and stepped up to 40% in 40 min followed by a 5 min wash at 98% B at 350 nl per min where solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and 5% DMSO in water and solvent B was 80% acetonitrile, 5% DMSO, and 0.1% formic acid in water. The total duration of the run was 100 min. Column temperature was kept at 60 °C by a peltier element-containing, in-house-developed oven. The mass spectrometer was operated in “top-15” data-dependent mode, collecting MS spectra in the Orbitrap mass analyzer (60,000 resolution, 300–1650 m/z range) with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3E6 and a maximum ion injection time of 15 ms. The most intense ions from the full scan were isolated with an isolation width of 1.5 m/z. Following higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27%, MS/MS spectra were collected in the Orbitrap (15,000 resolution) with an AGC target of 5E4 and a maximum ion injection time of 25 ms. Precursor dynamic exclusion was enabled with a duration of 30 s. For clinical AFib samples, a “top-5” data-dependent acquisition method as described above was modified to increase the dynamic range on the MS1 level by including three segmented MS scans (12 segments each; total AGC target 1E6), covering a m/z range of 400–1200. MS1 resolution was set to 120,000 at m/z 200 throughout.
MS data analysis
Tandem mass spectra were searched against the 2015 Uniprot human databases (UP000005640_9606 and UP000005640_9606_additional) using MaxQuant version 1.5.5.6 with a 1% FDR at the peptide and protein level, peptides with a minimum length of seven amino acids with carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification, and N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidations as variable modifications. Enzyme specificity was set as C-terminal to arginine and lysine using trypsin as protease and a maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed in the database search. The maximum mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions was 4.5 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. If applicable, peptide identifications by MS/MS were transferred between runs to minimize missing values for quantification with a 0.7-min window after retention time alignment. Label-free quantification was performed with the MaxLFQ algorithm using a minimum ratio count of 1. For clinical AFib samples, the identification transfer was restricted to the healthy LA library only, and we set a minimum ratio count of 2 for label-free quantification.
Statistical analysis
Statistical and bioinformatics analysis was performed with the Perseus software (version 1.5.5.0), Microsoft Excel, and R statistical software. Proteins that were identified in the decoy reverse database or only by site modification were not considered for data analysis. We also excluded potential contaminants. Data were further filtered to make sure that identified proteins showed expression in all biological triplicates of at least one heart region and missing values were imputed on the basis of normal distribution (down shift = 1.8, width = 0.15). PCA analysis of the heart region and cell types relied on singular value decomposition and the original feature (protein) space was orthogonally transformed into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables (principal components). These account for distinct types of variability in the data. For hierarchical clustering, LFQ intensities were first z-scored and clustered using Euclidean as a distance measure for column and row clustering. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using gene set collections from the MSigDB. Mean log2 ratios of biological triplicates and the corresponding p values were visualized with volcano plots. We used t-test for binary comparisons and SAM with s 0 = 0.1 and FDR < 0.05 for the assessment of t-test results in volcano plots.
Copy number calculation and subcellular heart proteome model
Conversion of LFQ intensities to copy number estimations was achieved using the proteomic ruler. The proteomic ruler plug-in v.0.1.6 was downloaded from the Perseus plug-in store, for use with Perseus version 1.5.5.0. Protein intensities were filtered for three valid values in at least one heart region. Proteins belonging to the GO term “blood microparticle” were removed from the analysis (see Supplementary Data 3 for a full list of removed proteins). Protein groups (proteins that can be distinguished based on the available peptide information) were annotated with amino acid sequence and tryptic peptide information for the leading protein ID, using the .FASTA file used for processing in MaxQuant. Copy numbers per diploid nucleus were estimated using the following settings: averaging mode—“All columns separately,” molecular masses—“average molecular mass,” detectability correction—“Number of theoretical peptides,” scaling mode—“Histone proteomic ruler,” ploidy “2,” and total cellular protein concentration—“200 g per l.” To build a subcellular model of the heart atlas proteome, subcellular localization predictions from spatial proteomics data were matched to the protein groups using the leading canonical protein ID. The median copy number of the three replicates was multiplied by the protein molecular weight to calculate protein mass. The mass of each protein was attributed to the nucleus, cytosol, or a specific organelle according to its distribution in HeLa cells. Since many highly abundant heart-specific proteins were not present in this spatial proteomics database, the top 100 proteins in each heart region were completed for subcellular localization using annotation from UniProt. These manually annotated protein masses were assigned entirely to the respective organelle. This led to a median of 94% of total protein mass being assigned to a specific location.
