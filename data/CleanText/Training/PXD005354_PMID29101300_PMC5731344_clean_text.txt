ABSTRACT:
Abstract
Most molecular cancer therapies act on protein targets but data on the proteome status of patients and cellular models for proteome‐guided pre‐clinical drug sensitivity studies are only beginning to emerge. Here, we profiled the proteomes of 65 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines to a depth of > 10,000 proteins using mass spectrometry. Integration with proteomes of 90 CRC patients and matched transcriptomics data defined integrated CRC subtypes, highlighting cell lines representative of each tumour subtype. Modelling the responses of 52 CRC cell lines to 577 drugs as a function of proteome profiles enabled predicting drug sensitivity for cell lines and patients. Among many novel associations, MERTK was identified as a predictive marker for resistance towards MEK1/2 inhibitors and immunohistochemistry of 1,074 CRC tumours confirmed MERTK as a prognostic survival marker. We provide the proteomic and pharmacological data as a resource to the community to, for example, facilitate the design of innovative prospective clinical trials.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
All cell lines in the CRC65 panel apart from SW480 (kind gift from Ulrike Stein from the MDC, Berlin) were collected by the laboratory of Prof Sir Walter Bodmer FRS at the University of Oxford and were previously HLA‐typed and characterised for other genetic changes to determine whether they are derived from cancers of different donors (Emaduddin et al, 2008). Information on the CRC65 cell lines and the CPTAC tumour samples like MSI status, original sources (cell lines) or subtype membership is compiled in Table EV6A.
Patient samples
We analysed the expression of MERTK in 1,074 patients from the QUASAR 2 clinical trial cohort, with approval from the West Midlands Research Ethics Committee (Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK; REC reference: 04/MRE/11/18). All participants provided written informed consent for treatment, and separate consent was obtained regarding the use of tumour tissue. QUASAR 2 is a phase III international randomised controlled trial, which collected data on toxicity, overall survival (OS), disease‐free survival (DFS) and recurrence‐free survival (RFS) for 1,941 stage II/III CRC patients, with the aim to determine the efficacy of adjuvant capecitabine±bevacizumab after resection of the primary tumour. A biobank comprising 1,350 FFPE blocks was established, and tissue microarrays (TMAs) were generated from 1.2‐mm cores.
Cell culture and lysis
Slightly altering the culture conditions described by Emaduddin et al (2008), cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, including GlutaMAX and pyruvate; PAA) containing 1% Pen‐Strep (penicillin at 100 units/ml and streptomycin at 100 μg/ml final concentration, PAA) and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS, SLI EU‐000F Batch 503005) in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 10% CO2 using T‐175 flasks (Corning). Hereafter, this medium composition is referred to as “culture medium” and the culture conditions apart from the culture vessel are referred to as “standard culture conditions”. Adherent cells were harvested at ~80–90% confluency. Suspension cells (e.g. HDC‐135) growing in 250 ml of culture medium were harvested by centrifugation in 250‐ml centrifuge tubes (Corning) at 300 ×g and 4°C for 5 min. We used RIPA100 buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X‐100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) containing protease (Complete™ mini with EDTA; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2; Sigma Aldrich) at 2× and 5× the final concentration recommended by the manufacturer, respectively, and lysed the cells for 30 min at 4°C. After clearing the total cell lysates (TCLs) at 22,000 ×g for 30 min at 4°C, the protein concentration was determined using a Coomassie‐based protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher) and the TCLs were stored at −80°C until further use.
Cell viability assays
We performed in vitro cell viability assays in order to test our in silico predictions. Assays were performed as described previously (Garnett et al, 2012), with minor modifications. Cell viability assays were carried out in technical triplicates in order to generate 10‐point dose–response curves for drugs with the resistance of which either ACVR2A or MERTK was associated. For each drug, we selected three cell lines predicted to be resistant and three cell lines predicted to be sensitive towards the respective drug and seeded them in 100 μl culture medium at their optimal seeding density on day zero (C10 = 4,000, CaCo‐2 = 2,000, CC07 = 4,000, HDC‐143 = 12,000, SK‐CO‐1 = 8,000, T84 = 11,000, RKO = 4,000, LS 180 = 2,000, HDC‐111 = 4,000, HT55 = 12,000, OXCO‐1 = 8,000, C125‐PM = 11,000). Following an overnight incubation under standard culture conditions, 50 μl of fresh medium containing either 1% DMSO or the respective drug in a 9‐point twofold dilution series in 1% DMSO was added to the corresponding wells. This resulted in a final DMSO concentration of 0.33%, while the highest final drug concentration was 10 μM for UNC569 (Merck), as well as 0.5 μM for PD‐0325901, 5 μM for RDEA119, 0.5 μM for AUY922 (all from Cambridge Bioscience) and 16 μM for BAY 61‐3606 (Insight Biotechnology), respectively. For drug co‐treatments, the respective compounds were combined at constant ratios over the entire concentration range used for the single‐agent treatments, keeping the final DMSO concentration in the assay at 0.33%. After 72 h of incubation time under standard culture conditions, the medium was either replaced with 150 μl of fresh culture medium containing 1 μM of Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher #H3570) or 10 μl AlamarBlue (Thermo Fisher #88952) added to each well (only  and ). Cells were incubated under standard culture conditions for 1 h or 4 h, respectively, before they were either imaged using an In Cell Analyzer 6000 automated confocal microscope (GE Healthcare) with four fields of view (FOVs) per well or before AlamarBlue fluorescence was quantified using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). The Hoechst 33342 channel of all images was subsequently analysed with Columbus v2.6.0 (PerkinElmer) using two of the built‐in algorithms “B” and “C” to automatically segment nuclei. For each well, we then counted the number of nuclei satisfying standard quality control criteria in all four FOVs. Subsequently, the nuclei count or AlamarBlue fluorescence was normalised to the mean of the corresponding DMSO controls, followed by dose–response modelling and parameter extraction (Appendix Supplementary Methods).
CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of MERTK in C10 cells
Knockout of MERTK in C10 cells was installed by CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting as described previously (Ran et al, 2013). Guide RNA sequences were selected by using the CRISPR Design Tool (http://www.genome-engineering.org/crispr/?page_id=41). Three guide RNAs targeting exons 7, 8 (encoding the FNIII domain) and 14 (encoding the kinase domain) of MERTK were obtained, which were designed to induce double‐strand breaks at position 982, 1,273 and 1,882 bp. The guide RNA sequences were cloned into pSpCas9(BB)‐2A‐GFP (the vector was a gift from Feng Zhang; Addgene plasmid #48138) by standard Golden Gate Assembly using the BbsI site, followed by transformation of chemically competent DH5α cells. Three colonies of each sgRNA transformation were picked and the correct insertion confirmed by sequencing. C10 cells were transfected with a mixture of all three sgRNAs using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were microscopically identified by expression of GFP and sub‐cloned 3 days post‐transfection using cloning rings. After 2–4 weeks, individual cell clones were tested for successful knockout of MERTK by Western blot and sequencing.
Western blots
Total cell lysates were diluted to 1 mg/ml protein concentration and 1× final sample buffer concentration with 4× sample buffer (70 mM Tris pH 6.8, 5% v/v 2‐mercaptoethanol, 40% v/v glycerol, 3% w/v SDS, 0.05% w/v bromophenol blue) and stored at −80°C until further use. Samples were separated using 4‐12% NuPAGE Bis‐Tris mini/midi gels (70 μg/14 μg per sample) and subsequently blotted to Hybond‐P PVDF (Amersham) or nitrocellulose (iBlot Transfer Stack, Thermo Fisher) membranes according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used primary antibodies against EPHA4 (ab157588, 1:500, Abcam), ABL1 (OP20, 1:1,000, Merck), BRAFV600E (E19290, 1:500, Spring Bioscience) and ERK1/2 (#4695, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology) for PVDF and primary antibodies against MERTK (ab52968, 1:2,000, Abcam) and ACTB (sc‐47778, 1:1,000, Santa Cruz) for nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated in the dark with appropriate fluorophore‐coupled secondary antibodies (IRDye 800CW goat anti‐mouse IgG #926‐32210, IRDye 680RD donkey anti‐rabbit IgG #926‐68023, IRDye 800CW goat anti‐rabbit IgG #926‐32211 and IRDye 680RD goat anti‐mouse IgG #925‐68070). Membranes were measured using an Odyssey near‐infrared scanner (LI‐COR). Densitometry of Western blots was carried out using ImageStudioLite v5.2.5 (LI‐COR), expressing EPHA4 and ABL1 expression relative to the respective ERK1/2 signal, followed by dividing all expression values by the expression value of OXCO‐1 (present on each gel) and log2‐transformation.
Immunohistochemistry
In order to evaluate MERTK expression in tissue microarrays, a staining protocol was developed using positive and negative control cell lines for MERTK expression, selected based on the expression level as measured by LC‐MS/MS. For each of the four control cell lines (negative: RKO, CC07; positive: HT55, CaCo‐2), we grew one T‐175 flask under standard culture conditions in culture medium to ~70% confluency, washed the cells once with 10 ml ice‐cold PBS and subsequently scraped them into 2 ml 4% PFA in PBS, followed by centrifugation at 400 ×g for 10 min and fixation overnight. Afterwards, the cell pellets were embedded in paraffin using standard procedures. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of QUASAR 2 TMAs and FFPE control cell pellets was carried out as already described (Schlegel et al, 2013), with minor modifications. Stainings quantifying MERTK expression were performed using the Bond‐MAX automated IHC system (Leica Biosystems) at room temperature if not specified otherwise. After deparaffinising and re‐hydrating the slides, heat‐induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was performed for 10 min at 100°C with epitope retrieval solution 1 (AR9961, pH 6). MERTK was detected using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (DS9800) together with a primary antibody against MERTK (ab52968, 1:1,000, Abcam) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by counterstaining nuclei with haematoxylin solution (< 0.1% haematoxylin). Slides were washed, dehydrated with an increasing alcohol series (30 s in 50, 70, 100 and 100% EtOH), cleared with two 30‐s washes in 100% xylene and subsequently mounted using DPX mountant (Sigma Aldrich). Finally, slides were scanned at 40× magnification using a ScanScope (Aperio).
Sample processing for mass spectrometry
Full proteomes
Acetone precipitation and re‐solubilisation
TCLs were first acetone‐precipitated overnight using four volumes of pre‐cooled (−40°C) acetone to remove detergents, followed by two additional washing steps with 1 ml fresh, cold acetone. In between precipitation and washing steps, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 ×g and 4°C. After the final washing step, the supernatant was taken off and the samples were left to dry in a fume hood at room temperature. Following acetone precipitation, the samples were re‐suspended in urea buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl pH = 7.6, 8 M urea) containing protease (Complete mini without EDTA; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2; Sigma Aldrich) at 1× and 5× the final concentration recommended by the manufacturer, respectively, as well as 20 nM calyculin A. In order to ensure proper re‐solubilisation of proteins, the precipitates were first mixed thoroughly by pipetting up and down, followed by sonication of each sample for 5 min on ice using an HF generator GM mini20, equipped with an ultrasonic converter UW mini20 and a microtip MS 2.5 sonotrode (Bandelin), which was set to 3‐s pulses at 30% intensity with 3‐s pause in between. After re‐solubilisation, the protein concentration of the lysate was determined again using a Coomassie‐based protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher).
In‐solution digestion
For in‐solution digestion of proteins, 3.5 mg of TCL per sample was reduced with 10 mM DTT and subsequently alkylated using 55 mM chloroacetamide. Afterwards, samples were diluted with 40 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.6 to reduce the urea concentration to 1.5 M, 1.5 μl of CaCl2 was added to each sample and proteins were digested overnight at 37°C and 700 rpm in a thermomixer using trypsin (Roche) at a protease‐to‐protein ratio of 1:50.
Desalting
Desalting of peptide mixtures was carried out at room temperature using Sep‐Pak cartridges (50 mg sorbent per cartridge, Waters) and a vacuum manifold according to the manufacturer's instructions. Desalted samples were stored at −80°C until further use.
hSAX chromatography
For hydrophilic strong anion exchange (hSAX) chromatography, peptide solutions were first dried down in a Speed‐Vac, re‐solubilised in hSAX solvent A (5 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.5) to a concentration of 2.73 μg/μl peptide and then centrifuged for 30 s at 5,000 ×g to spin down insoluble debris. Chromatography was carried out using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher), which was equipped with an IonPac AG24 guard column (Thermo Fisher), as well as an IonPac AS24 strong anion exchange column (Thermo Fisher). Chromatography was performed at 30°C and a flow rate of 250 μl/min. Following the injection of 100 μl sample and 3 min of equilibration with 100% hSAX solvent A, peptides were eluted using a two‐step linear gradient from 0 to 25% hSAX solvent B (5 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.5, 1 M NaCl) in 24 min and from 25 to 100% solvent B in 13 min. Solvent B was kept at 100% for another 4 min to flush the column before returning to 0% in 1 min and additional 5 min of equilibration with 100% hSAX solvent A. We started collecting 48 fractions of 250 μl after 2 min of gradient time, which were subsequently combined to form 24 fractions after consulting the 214‐nm chromatography trace. For that, fractions 5–7 were pooled to form fraction 5, fractions 24–25 formed fraction 22, fractions 26–28 formed fraction 23 and fractions 29–48 formed fraction 24, respectively.
Post‐hSAX desalting
All 24 fractions were desalted using StageTips as described earlier (Rappsilber et al, 2007), with minor modifications. Briefly, we used five C18 discs (3M Empore) of about 1.5 mm diameter in 200‐μl pipette tips. After wetting (MeOH followed by 5% TFA in 80% ACN) and equilibration of stage tips (0.1% TFA), acidified samples (pH 2) were loaded twice onto the StageTips to ensure proper binding. Following two washes with 0.1% TFA, samples were eluted using 200 μl 0.1% TFA in 60% ACN. Eluates were transferred to 96‐well plates, evaporated to dryness using a Speed‐Vac and subsequently stored at −20°C until further use.
Kinobeads
Kinobeads gamma (KBγ) pulldowns (biological triplicates) were performed in 96‐well filter plates (Porvair Sciences) as described elsewhere (Medard et al, 2015), with minor modifications. For each pulldown, 3 ml of 2.2 mg/ml TCL was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 167,000 ×g and 4°C for 20 min. Following washing (CP buffer: 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4) and equilibration (CP buffer supplemented with 0.4% Igepal CA‐630) of 35 μl settled KBγ per TCL, ~1.8 ml (equivalent of 4 mg of protein) of each TCL was transferred to its corresponding well. After 60‐min incubation at 4°C on a head‐over‐end shaker, the beads were washed thrice with CP buffer containing 0.4% Igepal CA‐630 and twice with CP buffer containing 0.2% Igepal CA‐630. Subsequently, proteins were eluted by incubating the beads for 30 min at 50°C and 700 rpm in a thermomixer with 60 μl of 2× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher) per well. After collecting eluates by centrifugation, samples were alkylated using 55 mM chloroacetamide. Finally, detergents and salts were removed from samples by running a short electrophoresis (~0.5 cm) using 4−12% NuPAGE gels (Thermo Fisher), followed by tryptic in‐gel digestion according to the standard procedures.
LC‐MS/MS data acquisition
Full proteomes
Reverse‐phase gradient
Full proteome fractions were measured using nanoflow LC‐MS/MS by directly coupling an Eksigent nanoLC‐Ultra 1D+ (Eksigent) to an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Peptides were dissolved in 20 μl buffer A (0.1% FA), injecting 5 μl per measurement. Using a flow rate of 5 μl/min, peptides were then loaded onto a 2‐cm trap column (100 μm i.d., ReproSil‐Pur 120 ODS‐3 5 μm, Dr. Maisch) and washed for 10 min with 100% buffer A. Subsequently, peptides were separated on a 40‐cm analytical column (75 μm i.d., ReproSil‐Gold 120 C18 3 μm, Dr. Maisch) using a flow rate of 300 nl/min and a gradient from 2% buffer B (0.1% FA and 5% DMSO in ACN) to 4% in 2 min (buffer A now also contained 5% DMSO) and from 4 to 32% in 96 min. Buffer B was then ramped from 32 to 80% in 1 min and the column was flushed with 80% buffer B for 4 min, before returning to 2% buffer B in 2 min and a final equilibration step with 2% buffer B for 5 min. This resulted in a turnaround time of 120 min per full proteome fraction, totalling 130 days of measurement time for the entire CRC65 cell line panel.
Acquisition parameters
The eluate from the analytical column was sprayed via stainless steel emitters (Thermo) at a source voltage of 2.6 kV towards the orifice of the mass spectrometer; a transfer capillary heated to 275°C. The Orbitrap Velos was set to data‐dependent acquisition in positive ion mode, automatically selecting the top 10 most intense precursor ions from the preceding full MS (MS1) spectrum with an isolation width of 2.0 Th for fragmentation using higher‐energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at 30% normalised collision energy and subsequent identification by MS/MS (MS2). MS1 (360–1,300 m/z) and MS2 (precursor‐dependent m/z range, starting at m/z 100) spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap using a resolution of 30,000 and 7,500 at m/z 400, with an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 1 × 106 and 3 × 104 charges and a maximum injection time of 100 and 200 ms, respectively. Dynamic exclusion was set to 60 s.
Kinobeads
Reverse‐phase gradient
Kinobeads eluates were measured using nanoflow LC‐MS/MS by directly coupling an Eksigent nanoLC‐Ultra 1D+ (Eksigent) to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Chromatography as well as data acquisition was similar to the settings used for full proteome fractions; hence, we only describe differences between the two set‐ups. We injected 10 μl per measurement instead of 5 μl and used a slightly steeper gradient from 2% buffer B to 4% in 2 min and from 4 to 32% in 88 min instead of 96 min. The rest of the gradient was kept the same, resulting in a turnaround time of 110 min per Kinobeads pulldown, totalling ~15 days of measurement time for the entire CRC65 cell line panel in biological triplicates.
Acquisition parameters
The source voltage was at 2.2 kV instead of 2.6 kV and the Orbitrap Elite selected the top 15 most intense precursor ions for MS2 instead of the top 10 most intense ones because of its higher scanning speed. While the MS1 m/z range, resolution, AGC target value and maximum injection time were the same as for the Orbitrap Velos, the Orbitrap Elite acquired MS2 spectra at a resolution of 15,000 at m/z 400 with an AGC target value of 2 × 104 charges and a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s instead of 60 s and the Orbitrap Elite also made use of a global kinase peptide inclusion list, which contained precursor ions and retention times from frequently observed kinase peptides.
Processing of LC‐MS/MS raw data
Full proteomes and CPTAC patient data
MaxQuant v.1.5.3.30 (Cox & Mann, 2008) was used to search our LC‐MS/MS raw data, as well as the raw data from the original CPTAC publication on human colon and rectal cancer (Zhang et al, 2014) against the UniProtKB human reference proteome (v25.11.2015; 92,011 sequences), concatenated with a list of common contaminants supplied by MaxQuant (245 sequences) in two separate runs with identical settings. Therefore, some data used in this publication were generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI/NIH). We set the digestion mode to fully tryptic, allowing for cleavage before proline (Trypsin/P) and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionines and acetylation of protein N‐termini were set as variable modifications, allowing for a maximum number of five modifications per peptide. Candidate peptides were required to have a length of at least seven amino acids, with a maximum peptide mass of 4,600 Da. The fragment ion tolerance was set to 20 ppm for FTMS (CRC65) and 0.4 Da for ITMS spectra (CPTAC), respectively. A first search with a precursor ion tolerance of 20 ppm was used to recalibrate raw data based on all peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) without filtering using hard score cut‐offs. After recalibration, the data were searched with a precursor ion tolerance of 4.5 ppm, while chimeric spectra were searched a second time using MaxQuant's “Second peptides” option to identify co‐fragmented peptide precursors. We used “Match between runs” with an alignment time window of 30 min and a match time window of 1.1 min to transfer identifications between raw files of the same and neighbouring fractions (± 1 fraction). Using the classical target‐decoy approach with a concatenated database of reversed peptide sequences, data were filtered using a PSM and protein false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. Protein groups were required to have at least one unique or razor peptide, with each razor peptide being used only once during the calculation of the protein FDR. No score cut‐offs were applied in addition to the target‐decoy FDR.
Kinobeads
Raw files from triplicate Kinobeads pulldowns were processed using a pipeline similar to the one employed for the analysis of full proteomes, adapting some of the parameters described hereafter. The fragment ion tolerance was set to 120 ppm for FTMS spectra instead of 20 ppm, since we observed systematic fragment mass deviations, which were linearly dependent on the m/z of the fragment ions in ppm space. Because this was likely due to problems during data acquisition, we had to compensate for it during the processing of raw data. Since Kinobeads pulldowns were not fractionated, “Match between runs” was used with the same parameters as described above to transfer identifications between all raw files.
Quantification, statistical analysis and multi‐omics data integration
Proteins detected in proteomics experiments were quantified based on MaxQuant output data, which was subsequently integrated with transcriptomics data from various CRC samples (see Appendix Supplementary Methods for details). All statistical analyses were carried out using R v3.2.4 (R Core Team, 2016).
