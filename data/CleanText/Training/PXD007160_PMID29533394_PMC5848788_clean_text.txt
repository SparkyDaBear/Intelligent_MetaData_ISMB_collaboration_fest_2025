ABSTRACT:
Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) often have overlap in clinical presentation and brain neuropathology suggesting that these two diseases share common underlying mechanisms. Currently, the molecular pathways linking AD and PD are incompletely understood. Utilizing Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) isobaric labeling and synchronous precursor selection-based MS3 (SPS-MS3) mass spectrometry, we performed an unbiased quantitative proteomic analysis of post-mortem human brain tissues (n=80) from four different groups defined as controls, AD, PD, and co-morbid AD/PD cases across two brain regions (frontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus). In total, we identified 11 840 protein groups representing 10 230 gene symbols, which map to ~65% of the protein coding genes in brain. The utility of including two reference standards in each TMT 10-plex assay to assess intra- and inter-batch variance is also described. Ultimately, this comprehensive human brain proteomic dataset serves as a valuable resource for various research endeavors including, but not limited to, the identification of disease-specific protein signatures and molecular pathways that are common in AD and PD.

Methods
Human brain tissue
Post-mortem tissues from the dorsolateral prefrontal frontal cortex (Frontal Cortex, Brodmann Area 9) and anterior cingulate gyrus (Cingulate, Brodmann Area 24) was obtained from the Emory Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) brain bank. Both regions are affected in AD, whereas Lewy body densities in anterior cingulate gyrus predict cognitive deficits in PD. Postmortem neuropathological evaluation of amyloid plaque distribution was performed according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) criteria, while the extent of neurofibrillary tangle pathology was assessed in accordance with the Braak staging system. All AD cases met NIA-Reagan criteria for the diagnosis of AD (high likelihood). Diagnoses were made in accordance with established criteria and guidelines for PD. Cases were classified as co-morbid AD and PD (AD/PD) when they met pathological criteria for amyloid plaque, neurofibrillary tangle and Lewy body burden. All case metadata including disease state, gender, race, apolipoprotein (ApoE) genotype, age of death, and post-mortem interval (PMI) are provided [Data citation 1].
Brain tissue homogenization and protein digestion
Procedures for tissue homogenization were performed essentially as described. In total, 40 samples across four pathological groups (n=10 per control, PD, AD and AD/PD groupings) were collected from each of the brain regions (frontal cortex and anterior cingulate); 31 of these cases had matched tissues across both brain regions [Data citation 1]. Approximately 100 mg (wet tissue weight) of brain tissue was homogenize in 8 M urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM NaHPO4, pH 8.5) with HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher) using a Bullet Blender (NextAdvance). Each Rino sample tube (NextAdvance) was supplemented with ~100 μL of stainless steel beads (0.9 to 2.0 mm blend, NextAdvance) and 500 μL of lysis buffer. Tissues were added immediately after excision and samples were then placed into the bullet blender (in 4 °C cold room). The samples were homogenized for 2 full 5 min cycles and the lysates were transferred to new Eppendorf Lobind tubes. Each sample was then sonicated for 3 cycles consisting of 5 s of active sonication at 30% amplitude followed by 15 s on ice. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 15 000 g and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Prior to further processing, protein integrity and concentration accuracy was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Figure 1). For protein digestion, 100 μg of each sample was aliquoted and volumes normalized with additional lysis buffer. Samples were reduced with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by 5 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) alkylation in the dark for another 30 min. Samples were then 8-fold diluted with 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Lysyl endopeptidase (Wako) at 1:100 (w/w) was added and digestion continued overnight. Trypsin (Promega) was then added at 1:50 (w/w) and digestion was carried out for another 12 h. The peptide solutions were acidified to a final concentration of 1% formic acid (FA) and 0.1% triflouroacetic acid (TFA) and desalted with a C18 Sep-Pak column (Waters). Each Sep-Pak column was activated with 1 mL of methanol, washed with 1 mL of 80% acetonitrile, and equilibrated with 2×1 mL 0.1% TFA. The samples were then loaded and each column was washed with 2×1 mL 0.1% TFA. Elution was performed with 2 rounds of 400 μL of 50% acetonitrile.
Tandem mass tag (TMT) peptide labeling
Assuming complete digestion of all samples, an aliquot equivalent to 20 μg was taken from each sample and combined to make a global internal standard (GIS) per brain region. All peptides mixtures were dried down under vacuum. For each tissue region, 5 batches of 10-plex TMT kits (ThermoFisher) were used to label the 40 samples and 10 GIS mixtures. Sample arrangement is shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. In each batch, TMT channels 126 and 131 were used to label GIS standards, while the 8 middle TMT channels were used to label 2 samples from each disease state. Labeling was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, each sample (80 μg of peptides each) was resuspended in 100 μL of 100 mM TEAB buffer. The TMT labeling reagents were equilibrated to room temperature and 41 μL anhydrous acetonitrile was added to each reagent channel and softly vortexed for 5 min. Peptide suspensions were transferred to the corresponding TMT channels and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 8 μl of 5% hydroxylamine. To ensure complete labeling select channels from each batch were analyzed by LC-MS/MS according to previously published methods. All 10 channels were then combined and dried by vacuum to~500 μL. Sep-Pak desalting was performed and the elution was dried to completeness.
Electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) fractionation
Dried samples were resuspended in 100 μL of ERLIC buffer A (90% acetonitrile with 0.1% acetic acid) and loaded onto a PolyWAX LP column (20 cm by 3.2 mm packed with 300 Å 5 μm beads from PolyLC Inc) as reported previously. An Agilent 1100 HPLC system consisting of a degasser, a binary pump, an autosampler, a microflow UV detector, and a fraction collector was used to carry out the fractionation. The gradient was from 0 to 50% ERLIC buffer B (30% ACN with 0.1% FA) over 45 min. A total of 44 fractions were collected and then combined to 21 fractions. Final fractions 1 to 20 consisted of alternating combinations (1 and 21, 2 and 22, etc.) and fraction 21 consisted of the last fractions (41 to 44) as previously described.
LC-MS/MS and TMT data acquisition on an orbitrap fusion mass spectrometer
Assuming equal distribution of peptide concentration across all 21 ERLIC fractions, 40 μL of loading buffer (0.1% TFA) was added to each of the fractions and 2 μL (2 μg equivalent) was separated on 25 cm long 75 μm ID fused silica columns (New Objective, Woburn, MA) packed in-house with 1.9 μm Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ resin (Dr Maisch). The LC-MS platforms consisted of a Dionex RSLCnano UPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer with a Flex nano-electrospray ion source (ThermoFisher). Sample elution was performed over a gradient of 3 to 30% Buffer B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) over 105 min, from 30 to 60% B over 20 min, and from 60 to 99% B over 5 min at 300 nl. The column was reconditioned with 99% B for 15 min at a flow rate of 500 nl/min and equilibrated with 1% B for 15 min at a flow rate of 350 nl/min. The Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Scientific) was operated in positive ion data dependent mode with synchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS3 analysis for reporter ion quantitation. The full scan was performed in the range of 380–1500 m/z at nominal resolution of 120 000 at 200 m/z and AGC set to 2×105, followed by selection of the most intense ions above an intensity threshold of 5000 for collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS2 fragmentation in the linear ion trap with 35% normalized collision energy. The isolation width for the frontal cortex samples was set to 1.5 m/z with a 0.5 m/z offset. For the anterior cingulate samples, the isolation width was set to 0.7 m/z with no offset. The top 10 fragment ions for each peptide MS2 was notched out with an isolation width of 2 m/z and co-fragmented to produce MS3 scans analyzed in the Orbitrap at a nominal resolution of 60 000 after higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) fragmentation at a normalized collision energy of 65%. Of note, one sample (fraction 19) in Batch 1 from the cingulate gyrus was run in technical replicate. All resulting raw files (n=211) are provided [Data Citation 2].
Protein identification and quantification
Raw data files from Orbitrap Fusion were processed using Proteome Discover (version 2.1). MS/MS spectra were searched against the UniProtKB Human proteome database (90 411 total sequences) [Data Citation 3] as previously reported. We chose to include both Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL sequences in the database as the additional depth provided by ERLIC fractionation enables the sequencing of rare protein isoforms (i.e., proteoforms) that may not be appreciated in human brain. Despite significantly more protein entries, searching with the entire UniprotKB database only added ~5% more unique protein groups compared to searches against the Swiss-Prot database alone (42 179 target sequences; downloaded on 11/18/2017). The respective FASTA database used in this study is deposited in the on the Synapse (www.synapse.org). SEQUEST parameters were specified as: trypsin enzyme, two missed cleavages allowed, minimum peptide length of 6, TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N-termini (+ 229.162932 Da) and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+ 57.02146 Da) as fixed modifications, oxidation of methionine residues (+ 15.99492 Da) and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (+0.984 Da) as a variable modification, precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 daltons. Peptide spectral match (PSM) error rates were determined using the target-decoy strategy coupled to Percolator modeling of true and false matches. Reporter ions were quantified from MS3 scans using an integration tolerance of 20 ppm with the most confident centroid setting. An MS2 spectral assignment false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1% was achieved by applying the target-decoy strategy. Following spectral assignment, peptides were assembled into proteins and were further filtered based on the combined probabilities of their constituent peptides to a final FDR of 1%. In cases of redundancy, shared peptides were assigned to the protein sequence with the most matching peptides, thus adhering to principles of parsimony. The search results and TMT quantification are included [Data Citation 4].

Technical Validation
Deep coverage of the human brain proteome
To reduce sample complexity and increase proteome depth, we employed off-line ERLIC fractionation prior to LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1a). We used 10 batches (5 per brain region) of 10-plex TMT labeling kits, and separated these peptide mixtures into fractions for each batch followed by LC-MS/MS analysis on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. Each batch had an equal number of control, AD, PD and AD/PD cases (2 per batch). Notably, two TMT channels in each batch were dedicated to global reference internal standards (GIS), representing an equivalent amount of pooled peptides from all cases analyzed in each brain region.
Following database search, a total of 127 321 unique peptides were identified that mapped to 11 840 protein groups at a 1% FDR on the peptide spectrum match (PSM) level across all samples, which represented 10 230 coding gene products (Fig. 1b). For each batch, ~8000 protein groups were identified. Total numbers of identified peptides, proteins and PSMs for both brain regions are listed in Tables 1 and 2.
To evaluate the depth of our data set, we compared the overlap of our proteomic data with available brain specific (cerebral cortex) RNA-seq data downloaded from the Human Protein Atlas website (Supplementary Table 3 and 4). RNA transcript abundances were calculated as transcripts per million (TPM) reads, which is measured by multiplying the estimated fraction of transcripts generated by a given gene. Notably, TPM is considered more comparable between samples of different origins and composition. If we considered all genes identified by RNA-seq with no TPM cutoff, the 10 230 translated gene products identified in our proteomics analysis corresponds to ~58% (9828/17068) of all expressed genes found in the RNA-seq dataset (Fig. 1d). The proteins identified in the frontal cortex and anterior cingulate covered ~51% (8739/17068) and ~54% (9197/17068) of the expressed coding genes, respectively. To compare the degree of protein coverage for the highest and lowest expressed brain transcripts we generated an overlapping histogram. In general, the majority of abundant coding transcripts, within the range of 4–5 log2 TPM, were identified in our proteomic dataset. Notably, when enforcing a RNA-seq TPM filter cutoff of ≥1, which is typically employed to enrich for more reliably expressed genes, the percent of translated gene products identified in the proteome increased to ~65% (9488/14541) (Fig. 1c). Surprisingly, we noticed that some highly expressed genes with very high TPM values were not identified. Upon further examination many of these gene lacked suitable tryptic peptides. For example, MT-ND4L has a log2 TPM value of 13.7, yet the translated protein (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4L) only contains a single arginine available for trypsin cleavage resulting in 2 peptides that are not proteotypic (i.e., too long to be sequenced). Alternatively, there were also 402 gene-products identified in the proteome that were not identified by RNA-seq (Fig. 1d). Further analysis revealed that some of these proteins (n=114) had low coverage and were identified by only 1 PSM (Supplementary Figure 2) while others are related to blood and the lympathic system. Gene Ontologies (GO) for all proteins that did not overlap with the transcriptome is provided in Supplementary Table 4.
In data-dependent or ‘shotgun’ proteomics approaches, confidence of identification is directly related to the number of peptides and PSMs matched to a protein after database searching. In our dataset, more than 80% of proteins were identified by 2 or more unique peptides (Figs 2a and c) and more than 90% proteins were identified with at least 2 PSMs in both frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus (Figs 2b and d), which highlights the high identification confidence of this dataset. Collectively, these results show that prefractionation by ERLIC followed by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion can generate deep proteomes that cover the majority of expressed transcripts in human brain.
Proteome wide quantitation utilizing two global reference internal standards
A major advantage of the TMT method is the ability to quantify proteins from multiple samples simultaneously. Each channel can be used to label different samples, which enabled the multiplexing of 10 individual samples in one LC-MS/MS analysis. Typically, when analyzing more than 10 samples, a single TMT channel is dedicated as internal standard and included in each batch, which can be later used to normalize protein measurements within and across all samples. Similarly, in this study, we pooled equivalent amounts of peptides from all individual cases (specific to brain region) to generate a GIS. However, we decided to dedicate two TMT channels (126 and 131) to the GIS (Fig. 1a) and required that both GIS TMT channels be readily quantified for protein quantification across the batch. This filtering criterion decreased the number of protein groups from 11 840 to 11 611 across both brain regions, the latter of which we considered quantifiable protein groups. The lack of consistent GIS measurements within the batch could indicate low signal abundance or the ubiquitous nature of product ion selection. The GIS also allowed us to assess the intra-batch variability as these channels should show the same exact abundance after technical normalization. Indeed, TMT channel 126 and 131 reporter ion signals for identified proteins were very consistent and displayed an excellent linear relationship across batches (Fig. 3). However, there are some proteins that exhibited large variation in measurements, especially those with low abundance (Fig. 3). To enhance quantitative accuracy, we decided to implement filtering criteria based on the population wide standard deviation (SD) of the two GIS measurements. Based on the central limit theorem, the log2 ratio for the two GIS channels (log2 TMT channels 126/131) for all proteins measured should fit a standard Gaussian distribution with the mean at or near zero and SD representing the technical variation in protein measurement. Thus, the SD allows one to evaluate the accuracy of all protein measurements within each batch. Since the SD differed based on protein intensity, we subdivided all GIS normalized abundances into 5 sections (per order of magnitude). For example, when assessing Batch 1 from the frontal cortex (Fig. 4a), proteins with the highest normalized abundance (>log10 of 1) displayed high correlation (R2 close to 1) and the smallest SD. However, proteins with lower normalized abundance of less than 10 (<log10 of 1) had higher variance in measurement (R2=0.1372) and a larger SD. Consistent with these observations, the SD across the 5 sections decreased with increasing normalized abundance (Fig. 4b). Correlation and SD values for each section from all 10 batches are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Since each protein in this dataset has its own GIS measurement, we considered them outliers if their GIS measurement was 4 SD away from mean value in any given subsection. However, this is a user defined criterion and can be differ based on the biological or research question at hand. Following filtering based on our criteria, the resulting protein number in all 10 batches are shown in Supplementary Table 6.
To assess quantitative consistency across batches, the distribution of proteins according to the average of two normalized GIS signal abundances was also investigated. For the anterior cingulate, the distribution was very similar across all 5 batches, with more than half of proteins generating signal abundances >100 (log10 of 2). However, in the frontal cortex dataset, the protein distribution between batches differed. Protein abundances in batch 1 and batch 4 showed a similar distribution to all batches derived from the cingulate cortex. In contrast, batches 2, 3 and 5, had a larger proportion of proteins with a reduced normalized abundance (Fig. 4c); more than 90% of proteins had higher average normalized GIS abundance in batches 1 and 4 compared to batches 2, 3, and 5. Since we prepared all the samples together, used all the same buffers and loaded same amount of peptides, we presume that the differences may come from platform variations (e.g. LC and/or mass spectrometer). The Emory Integrated Proteomics Core has two Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometers that were used to analyze different batches of the frontal cortex dataset. Both instruments were equipped with the same exact Dionex LC and nano-column setup and had identical LC and MS parameter settings. Batches 1 and 4 were run on Platform 1 (Orbitrap Fusion1), whereas the other 3 batches were run on Platform 2 (Orbitrap Fusion2). Although the source of reduced signal intensities in Platform 2 is unclear, this difference informed our decision to analyze all TMT batches generated from the anterior cingulate on Platform 1, which resulted in higher signals and more identified proteins (Fig. 4d and Tables 1 and 2). Thus, by including the 2 GIS reference standards in each batch we could not only assess intra-batch variance in protein measurement, but also inter-batch variance due to platform differences. Furthermore, the two reference standards essentially serve as a null-experiment which allows investigators to filter outlier proteins measurements that don’t meet criteria for accuracy and precision as described above.
Usage Notes
Ultimately, this comprehensive human brain proteomic dataset serves as a valuable resource for variety research endeavors including, but not limited to, the following applications:
Use case 1: Protein expression
This dataset provides a quick and accurate reference for protein expression values, especially if an investigator wants to determine whether their protein of interest is abundantly expressed in human brain (Data Citation 4).
Use case 2: Disease specific differential protein expression
The inclusion of control as well as AD, PD and AD/PD groups allows for the differential comparison of proteins across disease outgroups. Investigators can focus on comparisons that are specific to either AD or PD or those that are altered in both neurodegenerative diseases. These types of analyses could serve investigators working with cellular and/or other model organisms at AD and PD, who would be interested in whether a protein or pathway exhibits expression preservation in relevant human brain tissue (Data Citation 4).
Use case 3: Protein Co-expression network analysis
More recently development in systems analysis approaches combined with deeper more comprehensive datasets such as this one, have enabled researchers the ability to look beyond standard differential expression analyses. Programs like WeiGhted Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and related alogrithms, give investigators a system wide view of protein expression patterns that highlight groups of proteins (i.e., modules) which correlate to molecular and biological functionalities as well as cellular localization and cellular origin. These programs can also readily correlate protein modules to case traits (clinical status and pathological burden) providing yet another level of analysis that can shed light on to the connection between protein co-expression and clinical diagnosis.
Use Case 4: Identification and quantification of post-translational modifications (PTMs)
The phosphorylation of tau and α-syn are common pathological features in both AD and PD and are thought to have important roles in disease progression and pathogenesis. Other PTMs have also been described for these proteins. Thus, the deep coverage and quantitative accuracy in this dataset may make it possible to detect highly abundant disease-specific PTMs on key substrates in both AD and PD. Although enrichment strategies would provide a more complete PTM profile, each type of modification requires a separate enrichment strategy that can be time consuming. This dataset provides a good starting point to identify the types of modifications that are most abundant for prioritization in future biological assays.
Use case 5: Identification of novel brain-specific splice variants and coding changes
The raw data in this study could be used to search for alternative transcripts (e.g., splice junction peptides), alternative start sites and even single nucleotide variants (SNVs).These may show up in RNA-seq analysis of human brain and could be confirmed to be expressed at the protein level utilizing this current dataset.
Use case 6: Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) or parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)
We have also supplied the peptide information (Data Citation 2), which includes more than 127 321 unique peptides, which can serve as a resource for PRM and SRM peptide candidate selection. This will complement currently available repositories such as the SRMAtlas.
