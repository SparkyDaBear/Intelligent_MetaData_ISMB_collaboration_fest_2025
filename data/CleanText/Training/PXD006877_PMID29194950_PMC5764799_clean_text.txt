ABSTRACT:
Summary
Stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is a quantitative proteomic method that can illuminate new pathways used by cells to adapt to different lifestyles and niches. Archaea, while thriving in extreme environments and accounting for ~20–40% of the Earth’s biomass, have not been analyzed with the full potential of SILAC. Here we report SILAC for quantitative comparison of archaeal proteomes, using Haloferax volcanii as a model. A double auxotroph was generated that allowed for complete incorporation of 13C/15N-lysine and 13C-arginine such that each peptide digested with trypsin was labeled. This strain was found amenable to multiplex SILAC by case study of responses to oxidative stress by hypochlorite. 2,565 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis (q-value ≤ 0.01) that accounted for 64% of the theoretical proteome. Of these, 176 proteins were altered at least 1.5-fold (p-value < 0.05) in abundance during hypochlorite stress. Many of the differential proteins were of unknown function. Transcription factor homologs dominated those of known function including those related to oxidative stress by 3D-homology modeling and orthologous group comparisons. Thus, SILAC is found to be an ideal method for quantitative proteomics of archaea that holds promise to unravel gene function.
METHODS:
Experimental Procedures
Materials
Biochemicals were from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Other inorganic and organic analytical grade chemicals were from Fisher-Scientific (Atlanta, GA, USA). Desalted oligonucleotide primers were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA). Polymerases, ligase, and restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA). Amino acid isotopes were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Tewksbury, MA, USA). Agarose for DNA analysis was purchased from Bio-Rad laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA).
Strains and media
Strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. E. coli strains Top10 and GM2163 were used for routine cloning and preparation of plasmid DNA for transformation into Hfx. volcanii, respectively. E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg·ml−1). Hfx. volcanii strains were grown at 42 °C at 200 rpm rotary shaking in ATCC974 (complex) medium or GMM, the latter medium with ammonium chloride as the nitrogen source. Media was supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg·ml−1), novobiocin (0.1 μg·ml−1), L-lysine, or L-arginine as needed. L-Lysine and L-arginine concentrations were 0.3 mM unless specified otherwise. Culture plates were supplemented with 1.5% (w/v) agar for LB medium and 2.0% (w/v) agar for GMM and ATCC974 medium. Growth was measured by the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) (where 1 OD600 unit equals approximately 109 CFU·ml−1).
Generation of mutant strains
Plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Table 2. Plasmids were constructed using one step sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC). Gene deletions were created by the strategy shown previously by Allers et al.. Gene homologs of lysA (HVO_1098; diaminopimelate decarboxylase EC 4.1.1.20) and argH (HVO_0048; argininosuccinate lyase EC 4.3.2.1) were targeted for markerless deletion on the Hfx. volcanii H26 genome. Colonies were screened for auxotrophy by growth on GMM plates with and without supplementation with L-arginine and/or L-lysine. The mutant strains were further analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic DNA as a template and primers that annealed outside of the plasmids used for homologous recombination. Mutants were further analyzed by Southern blotting in which genomic DNA was hybridized to digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) labeled probes. The DNA hybrids were detected on the blots using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody to digoxigenin and CDP-Star (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA, USA). The intensity of the DNA hybrid bands was visualized by X-ray film (Hyperfilm; Amersham Biosciences).
Growth assays for minimal amino acid
Hfx. volcanii ΔlysA and ΔargH mutants were tested for the minimum concentration of L-lysine and L-arginine required for optimal growth, respectively. Cells were grown in complex medium (ATCC974) to log phase (OD600 of 0.8). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 x g), washed three times in GMM, resuspended in 5 ml GMM, and subcultured to an OD600 of 0.01 in 25 ml of GMM supplemented with and without L-lysine or L-arginine (0 to 0.5 mM). Cultures were incubated with rotary shaking (200 rpm) at 42 °C in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Samples (0.1 to 1 ml) of culture were removed from 0–61 h for monitoring growth by OD600.
Assays of cell survival after exposure to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)
Hfx. volcanii H26 cells were grown to log phase (OD600 of 0.7) in 25 ml of GMM in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks in a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at 42 °C. To monitor survival after exposure to NaOCl, cells were treated with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 4, and 7.5 mM NaOCl (10 μl in dH2O; diluted from Sigma Aldrich product 425044) at room temperature (RT) with 10 sec of rotary shaking every 5 min for 20 min. Treated-cells were serially diluted in ATCC974 liquid and plated at 10−6 to 10−7 on ATCC974 plates. The colony forming units (CFU) per ml were determined to assess cell survival. To test recovery after long-term exposure of NaOCl, cells were grown to log phase as described above. The log phase cells were treated with 0, 2, 5, 8, and 11 mM NaOCl. Growth was monitored by OD600 for 15 h after treatment, and cells were plated for survival on ATCC974 plates. Experiments were performed in biological triplicate. To compare survival of Hfx. volcanii HM1041 (Δsamp1) to its parent H26, the cells were streaked onto GMM agar from −80 °C glycerol stocks and grown for 5 days in a closed plastic zippered bag at 42 °C. Isolated colonies were inoculated into 3 ml GMM in a capped 13 x 100 mm culture tube and incubated at 42 °C with rotary shaking (200 rpm). At an OD600 0.9, the cultures were normalized to 1 OD unit · ml −1 and serially diluted in GMM from 10−1 to 10−6. Culture dilutions (20 μl) were spotted serially on GMM agar plates supplemented with 0.8 mM NaOCl and a mock control. Plates were placed in a closed plastic zippered bag in a 42 °C incubator and allowed to grow for 5 days. As an added assay, H26 (parent) and HM1041 (Δsamp1) strains were streaked from −80°C glycerol stocks onto solid complex medium (ATCC974) and incubated as described above. Colonies were inoculated into 25 ml of ATCC974 medium in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Cells were grown to log phase (OD600 of 0.6–0.8) at 42 °C (200 rpm). Cells were washed twice with GMM by centrifugation (8,600 × g, 1 min at room temperature) and inoculated to a starting OD600 of 0.1 unit in GMM (5 ml) supplemented with and without 3 mM NaOCl. Cells were incubated at 42°C (200 rpm) in capped 13 × 100 mm culture tubes. Growth was monitored at OD600.
Ellman’s reagent assay for free sulfhydryl groups of NaOCl treated cells
Hfx. volcanii LM08 was grown to log phase (OD600 of 0.8) in 50 ml GMM supplemented with 0.3 mM L-lysine and 0.3 mM L-arginine in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks in a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at 42 °C. The cultures were immediately treated with 0 and 2.5 mM NaOCl in biological triplicate as described for survival assays. After the 20-min treatment, cells were pelleted at 4,000 x g and resuspended in 1 ml reaction buffer (0.1 sodium phosphate pH 8.0 with 1 mM EDTA). Cells were lysed on ice by sonication (Sonic Dismembrator Model 500, Fisher Scientific) at 30% amplitude for 2 sec on, 2 sec off for 20 sec total, three times over. Cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 x g and passed through a 0.2 μm surfactant-free cellulose acetate (SFCA) filter (Nalgene, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). The filtrate was quantified for total protein by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce, USA) and assayed for thiol content by Ellman’s reagent assay. In brief, the Ellman’s reagent was generated by dissolving 4 mg of 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (ThermoFisher Scientific) in 1 ml reaction buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA). Reactions (2.8 ml total volume) were mixtures of 50 μl Ellman’s reagent, 0.25 ml protein (0.97 mg total), and 2.5 ml reaction buffer in borosilicate glass tubes (13 x 100 mm Fisher Scientific). The reactions were vortexed to mix and incubated at RT for 15 min. Sample (250 μl) was transferred in triplicate to a clear polystyrene flat bottom 96-well plate (Fisher Scientific) and absorbance was measured at 412 nm using a Biotek Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader. L-Cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate (Fisher BioReagents, Fisher Scientific) was used as a standard to quantify the sulfhydryl groups.
Isotopic incorporation
Hfx. volcanii LM08 was streaked with a toothpick from 20% v/v glycerol stocks stored at −80 °C onto a plate of GMM supplemented with 0.5 mM lysine and 0.5 mM arginine and grown at 42 °C for 5 days. Isolated colonies were transferred to 25 ml GMM supplemented with either heavy or light amino acids separately (0.3 mM each) and allowed to grow for 24 h (about 6.5 doublings) (in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask at 42 °C in a rotary shaker at 200 rpm). Cultures were subcultured into 25 ml GMM to a starting OD600 of 0.01 and similarly grown in the same heavy or light medium for 24 h, twice sequentially for a total of three subcultures after 24 h each. The heavy amino acids were L-lysine+8 (L-lysine: 2HCl, 13C6, 99%; 15N2, 99%; Item No. CNLM-291-H-PK) and L-arginine+6 (L-arginine: HCl, 13C6, 99%; Item No. CLM-2265-H-PK) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). The light amino acids were L-lysine and L-arginine purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Item No. L8662 and A8094, respectively). The final cultures were harvested at log phase (OD600 0.6) by centrifugation at 4,000 x g. Proteins were extracted with TRIzol (ThermoFisher Scientific) as described previously. A preliminary study was done to determine the incorporation rate of heavy lysine (+8) and heavy arginine (+6) into the proteome. These preliminary untreated samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS to monitor isotope incorporation, as described below, with the following exceptions: 1) sulfhydryl groups of the proteins were alkylated by reacting with 50 mM iodoacetamide in the dark at room temperature for 45 min, 2) tryptic peptides were separated by a 60-min linear gradient with the Easy-nLC 1200 system, 3) strong cation exchange (SCX) was not used for separation of peptides, and 4) peptide masses were detected by a Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer.
Experimental design
Four biological replicates (n=4) of the Hfx. volcanii LM08 cells were grown in 25 ml of GMM at 42 °C in a rotary shaker (200 rpm) to late log phase (OD600 0.7–0.8). The cells were incubated for 20-min with 2.5 mM NaOCl (treatment groups) or dH2O (control groups) as described for the survival assays. For two of the biological replicates, the control group cultures were labeled with (heavy) L-lysine (+8) and L-arginine (+6) and the treatment group was labeled with (light) L-lysine (+0) and L-arginine (+0), as described above. The other two replicates were grown with the labels switched: (heavy) L-lysine+8 and L-arginine+6 for the treatment group and (light) L-lysine+0 and L-arginine+0 for the control. This experimental designed allowed for comparison of the label swap as well as an assessment of the impact of oxidative stress on the Hfx. volcanii proteome.
Preparation of protein samples for analysis by mass spectroscopy
Culture volumes were normalized in each centrifuge tube to equivalent total OD units per sample, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 x g). All supernatant was carefully removed. The cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. Cell pellets of control and treatment groups were mixed at a 1:1 ratio (n=4 mixed samples), and the proteins were extracted with TRIzol, as described previously. The protein pellets were stored at −20 °C and processed as described previously with a few modifications. Pellets were dissolved in a solubilization buffer [7 M urea, 2 M thiourea and 4% (w/v) CHAPS] and quantified by EZQ assay kit according to manufacturer instructions (Invitrogen Inc., Eugene, OR, USA). Protein (500 μg per 100 μl buffer) was reduced by addition of 2.5 μl of 50 mM tris-(2-carboxyethyl phosphine (TCEP) and incubating the sample at 60 °C for 60 min. After cooling the sample, the protein was treated with 5 μl of 200 mM methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) for 30 min in the dark and digested with 5 μg modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides were lyophilized and solubilized in 3% v/v acetonitrile in 0.1% v/v formic acid and desalted on a Macrospin C-18 reverse phase mini-column (The Nestgroup Inc., Southborough, MA, USA). Eluted peptides were lyophilized and fractionated by strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) as described previously with gradient as in at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. In brief, solvent A (25% v/v acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, and 0.1% v/v formic acid, pH 2.8) was applied for 10 min and a linear gradient of 0–20% solvent B (25% v/v acetonitrile and 500 mM ammonium formate, pH 6.8) was applied over 80 min before applying another 5-min gradient to 100% solvent B and holding for 10 min. Peptide elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm (A280). SCX fractions (14 total) were pooled and lyophilized. In addition, replicate 1 had one post-run fraction and replicates 2–4 have 5 post-run fractions that were included in the LC-MS/MS analysis.
Reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis
Fractions were resuspended in LC solvent A (0.1% v/v formic acid in 3% v/v acetonitrile) and analyzed one at a time on an Easy-nLC 1200 system coupled to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap Plus MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Peptides were concentrated on an Acclaim Pepmap 100 pre-column (20 mm × 75 μm; 3 μm-C18) and separated on a PepMap RSLC analytical column (250 mm × 75 μm; 2 μm-C18) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min using solvent A (0.1% v/v formic acid) and B (0.1% v/v formic acid and 99.9% v/v acetonitrile) at a gradient of 2–30% solvent B in 100 min, 30–98% solvent B in 10 min before an isocratic flow of 98% solvent B for 10 min. The separated peptides were analyzed on a Q-Exactive Plus MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) in positive ion mode and top 10 data dependent scanning with high collision dissociation (HCD) as previously described. Briefly, the spray voltage was 1800 V. The full MS resolution was 70,000 with a scan range of 350–1800 m/z, an AGC target of 3e6 and maximum IT of 250 ms. The MS/MS resolution was 17,500 with a scan range of 200–2000 m/z, an AGC target of 5e5, and maximum IT of 50 ms, the normalized collision energy of 27. The underfill ratio was 1%, intensity threshold was 2e5, charge exclusion was unassigned, 1, 7–8, and >8.
Data analysis and statistical rationale
Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used for protein identification and quantitation using the Hfx. volcanii DS2 database (downloaded from www.Uniprot.org April 2017) with 3,996 entries and NTRANS_0004. Proteome Discoverer was also used to generate the decoy database of the Hfx. volcanii proteome that was used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). Peptide and protein identification was set to an FDR adjusted p-value (or q-value) of 0.01 or less implying that 1% of significant tests would result in false positives. cRAP database was also searched for protein contaminants (none were detected at a q-value of 0.01 or less). Peptides were allowed two missed cleavages by trypsin and a static modification of methylthio on all cysteines. Dynamic modifications allowed were lysine +8, arginine +6, proline +5, methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, and diglycine remnant on lysines. Mass tolerance for precursor ions was 10 ppm. Mass tolerance for fragment ions was 0.02 Da. Peptide abundances were mean normalized and scaled by Proteome Discoverer. Peptides identified for each protein were used to find the statistical significance of protein abundance using Welch’s t-test in R (version 3.3.3) to a p-value of < 0.05. Ambiguous peptides and peptides with no or non-unique quantitative information were excluded in the analysis. The 50 most abundant proteins and 50 least abundant proteins were identified using the highest and lowest exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) values, respectively. For the least abundant proteins, the proteins were identified in at least three replicates, and the most abundant proteins were found in all four replicates. The effect of label swapping was tested using Welch’s t-test at p-value < 0.01 using the peptide abundances from the control groups in the 50 most abundant proteins by emPAI value found in all four replicates. Proline conversion was calculated by taking the top three most abundant proteins by emPAI value and counting the number of heavy prolines (+5) out of total proline residues. Protein arCOG information was found in www.uniprot.org. Transmembrane domains were determined by Expasy TMpred server.
