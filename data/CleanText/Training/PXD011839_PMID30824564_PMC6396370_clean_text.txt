ABSTRACT:
Abstract
Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 25% of the population and can progress to cirrhosis with limited treatment options. As the liver secretes most of the blood plasma proteins, liver disease may affect the plasma proteome. Plasma proteome profiling of 48 patients with and without cirrhosis or NAFLD revealed six statistically significantly changing proteins (ALDOB, APOM, LGALS3BP, PIGR, VTN, and AFM), two of which are already linked to liver disease. Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) was significantly elevated in both cohorts by 170% in NAFLD and 298% in cirrhosis and was further validated in mouse models. Furthermore, a global correlation map of clinical and proteomic data strongly associated DPP4, ANPEP, TGFBI, PIGR, and APOE with NAFLD and cirrhosis. The prominent diabetic drug target DPP4 is an aminopeptidase like ANPEP, ENPEP, and LAP3, all of which are up‐regulated in the human or mouse data. Furthermore, ANPEP and TGFBI have potential roles in extracellular matrix remodeling in fibrosis. Thus, plasma proteome profiling can identify potential biomarkers and drug targets in liver disease.

Ethical approval
The study protocol was approved by the scientific‐ethical committee of the Capital region of Denmark (H‐1‐2011‐082) and registered with the Danish Data Protection Agency (2011‐41‐6410) and ClinicalTrials.gov (reg. no. NCT01492283). The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and oral and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Study design
Plasma samples, all taken in the fasting state, were derived from two previously published studies. The details including corresponding clinical data and laboratory data are in Junker et al (2016, 2015), and the groups are briefly described below. Patients had I) normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and no liver disease, II) NGT and NAFLD, III) T2D without liver disease, IV) T2D with NAFLD, and V) cirrhosis. NAFLD was diagnosed based on histology and graded according to hepatic fat infiltration: no NAFLD (< 5% fat infiltration), mild (5–33%), moderate (33–66%), and severe (> 66%). Non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis were graded according to the NAFLD activity score. Eight of the 20 patients with NAFLD also had NASH/fibrosis (all below fibrosis score 5). Cirrhosis was diagnosed histologically and clinically, based on signs of decompensation (e.g., ascites).
Individuals with T2D were diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria. Exclusion criteria included weekly alcohol consumption of more than seven units for women and 14 units for men, treatment with steatogenic drugs within 3 months prior to inclusion, anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, gut resection, increased creatinine (> 150 μmol/l), albuminuria, or other chronic diseases. Controls were healthy (and matched with age, BMI, and gender) with no family history of diabetes, signs of liver disease (based on patient history, biochemical measurements, and ultrasound assessment), or other chronic diseases.
Mouse experiments
To induce substantial obesity and NAFLD, we fed 8‐week‐old male C57Bl6/J mice (Charles River, River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) with a high‐fat, high‐sugar diet (HFD) comprising 58% kcal from fat (D12331; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 32 weeks. Another 6 male C57Bl6/J mice were maintained on regular chow diet and switched to HFD for 5 weeks at an age of 34 weeks to induce mild obesity and NAFLD. Mice were single‐ or double‐housed on a 12:12‐h light–dark cycle at 22°C with free access to water and food. Sample size estimation was done the same as in the human study (see Study design).
Mouse pharmacology
The synthesis, purification, and characterization of the GLP‐1/GIP co‐agonist and the single GLP‐1 and GIP mono‐agonist controls were described previously, and the peptides were used without any further chemical modification or change in formulation (Finan et al, 2013). Whole‐body composition (fat and lean mass) was measured with nuclear magnetic resonance technology (EchoMRI, Houston, TX, USA). For the treatment study in mice with severe NAFLD, DIO mice maintained for 32 weeks on HFD and then randomized to either vehicle, GLP‐1, GIP, or GLP‐1/GIP treatment according to body weight and body composition. Mice with mild NAFLD were fed HFD for 5 weeks and then treated with vehicle for the same time period as the other mouse groups. Compounds were administered in a vehicle of PBS (Gibco) and were given by daily subcutaneous injections at a dose of 10 nmol/kg at a volume of 5 μl per g body weight for 15 days. The investigators were not blinded to group allocation during the in vivo experiment. All procedures were approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of Bavaria, Germany, in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Methods and Protocols
 Plasma sample preparation 
All plasma samples were prepared according to the previously published plasma proteome profiling pipeline on an automated liquid handling system (Agilent Bravo) in a 96‐well plate format (Geyer et al, 2016a). In brief, proteins were denatured, reduced, alkylated, and digested and peptides purified on StageTips (Kulak et al, 2014) using reagents from the PreOmics “iST” Kit (P.O. 00001, PreOmics GmbH).
In detail:
Transfer of 5 μl of blood plasma sample into an Eppendorf 96‐well plate at 4°C on an Agilent Bravo liquid handling system (Plasma plate).
Make a 1:10 dilution by adding 45 μl of SDC reduction and alkylation buffer (included in PreOmics “iST” kit) into each well of the Plasma plate, mix thoroughly by pipetting 50 times up and down for a volume of 40 μl, and centrifuge the plate up to 300 × g.
Pipet 20 μl of tenfold diluted plasma into a new 96‐well plate (Digestion plate).
Heat the plate at 95°C for 10 min.
Move the Digestion plate to room temperature and cool it down for 5 min. Meanwhile, prepare fresh trypsin/LysC mix in 0.05 (μg/μl) (total volume calculated by 20 μl per sample, 1:100 micrograms of enzyme to micrograms of protein).
Add 20 μl of trypsin/LysC mix into each well to a final volume of 40 μl.
Heat the Digestion plate at 37°C for 4 h (enzymatic digestion).
Quench the reaction by adding 40 μl of the PreOmics washing buffer 1, and mix thoroughly by pipetting 20 times up and down.
Prepare 96 StageTips on a home‐made 3D‐printed centrifugation block (2‐plug SDB‐RPS material (thickness 0.5 ± 0.05 mm) in 14‐gauge).
Transfer 24 μl of the mixture onto the StageTips. Centrifuge the StageTip block at 1,500 × g for 15 min.
Add 150 μl of the PreOmics washing buffer 1 to the StageTips, and centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 15 min.
Add 150 μl of the PreOmics washing buffer 2 to the StageTips, and centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 15 min.
Elute the peptides by adding 60 μl of elution buffer (1% ammonia in 80% acetonitrile), centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 15 min, and collect peptides in PCR tube‐stripes (0.2 ml volume).
Concentrate the peptide mixture by Speed‐Vac at 60°C under vacuum for 90 min.
Re‐suspend the peptide mixture in 40 μl of buffer A* (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA in ddH2O).
High‐pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry
Samples were measured using LC‐MS instrumentation consisting of an EASY‐nLC 1200 system coupled to a nano‐electrospray ion source and a Q Exactive HF Orbitrap (all Thermo Fisher Scientific). Purified peptides were separated on 40‐cm HPLC columns (ID: 75 μm; in‐house packed into the tip with ReproSil‐Pur C18‐AQ 1.9 μm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH)). For each LC‐MS/MS analysis, around 0.5 μg peptides was injected for the 45‐min gradients and 1 μg for the fractions of the deep plasma dataset.
Additionally, we established very deep plasma proteome libraries. We pooled samples from all healthy individuals, NAFLD patients, and liver cirrhosis patients separately and depleted the 14 highest abundant plasma proteins by serial depletion with a top6 (Multiple Affinity Removal Column Human 6; Agilent) and top14 depletion kits (Seppro Protein Depletion; Sigma‐Aldrich). After digestion, the peptides were separated by the Spider Fractionator (Kulak et al, 2017) into 24 fractions. This library was combined with an additional peptide library that had been established in the same way in a separate study (Wewer Albrechtsen et al, 2018).
Peptides were loaded in buffer A (0.1% formic acid, 5% DMSO (v/v)) and eluted with a linear 35‐min gradient of 3–30% of buffer B (0.1% formic acid, 5% DMSO, 80% (v/v) acetonitrile), followed by a 7‐min increase to 75% of buffer B and a 1‐min increase to 98% of buffer B, and a 2‐min wash of 98% buffer B at a flow rate of 450 nl/min. Column temperature was kept at 60°C by a Peltier element containing an in‐house‐developed oven. For human plasma, MS spectra were acquired with a Top15 data‐dependent MS/MS scan method (topN method) for the library and with the BoxCar scan method for study samples (Meier et al, 2018). The target value for the full scan MS spectra was 3 × 106 charges in the 300–1,650 m/z range with a maximum injection time of 55 ms and a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200. Fragmentation of precursor ions was performed by higher‐energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy of 27 eV. MS/MS scans were performed at a resolution of 15,000 at m/z 200 with an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 5 × 104 and a maximum injection time of 25 ms. For mouse plasma, MS spectra were acquired with a data‐independent acquisition (DIA) method. The DIA‐MS method consisted of an MS1 scan from 350 to 1,650 m/z range (AGC target of 3 × 106, maximum injection time of 50 ms) at a resolution of 120,000 and 22 DIA segments (AGC target of 3 × 106, maximum injection time of 54 ms) at a resolution of 30,000 (Dataset EV3). Normalized stepped collision energy was set to 25, 27.5, 30, with a default charge state of 2. The acquisition of samples was randomized to avoid bias.
Data analysis
For human plasma, mass spectrometric raw files were analyzed in the MaxQuant environment v.1.5.8.6 (Cox & Mann, 2008) employing the Andromeda search engine (Cox et al, 2011). The MS/MS spectra were searched against the human UniProt FASTA database (version 201704, 157,510 entries). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages, and the search included cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification and oxidation on methionine and N‐terminal acetylation as variable modifications with a minimum required peptide length of 7 amino acids. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 was set at the peptide and protein levels. Study samples were analyzed together with our in‐house generated matching library and the “match between runs” algorithm (Nagaraj et al, 2012). Label‐free quantitation (LFQ) was performed with a minimum ratio count of 2 and normalized in a separate group from the library raw files (Cox et al, 2014).
After filtering for “reverse”, “only identified by site”, “contaminants”, and at least two valid values in any of the three technical replicates, we came to a dataset containing 684 protein groups (Dataset EV1, tab 2). We took the median value from the technical triplicates and further filtered the dataset for 70% data completeness in at least one experimental group. This resulted in 520 protein groups with 11% missing values (Dataset EV1, tab 3). We then replaced the missing values by drawing random samples from a normal distribution (downshifted mean by 1.8 standard deviation (SD) and scaled SD (0.3) relative to that of proteome abundance distribution). This further resulted in a final dataset (Dataset EV1, tab 4) with which we performed the statistical analysis (except for global correlation analysis, which we filtered for 70% data completeness across all samples instead of one sub‐group, resulting in 431 protein groups, without imputation (Dataset EV1, tab 5)).
For mouse plasma, DIA raw data were analyzed with Spectronaut Pulsar X™ with an in‐house generated spectra library of mouse plasma that contains 8,899 peptides and 1,458 protein groups (mouse FASTA UniProt FASTA database version 201806 containing 92,096 entries). Spectronaut Pulsar X™ was used with default settings for DIA data with the decoy generation set to “mutated”.
Bioinformatic analysis
Bioinformatic analysis was performed in the Perseus platform (Tyanova et al, 2016) and Python scripts. Two‐sample Student's t‐test was used to determine the significantly changed proteins between disease and control groups with a permutation‐based FDR of 0.05. For significant hits, minimal fold changes together with P‐values (controlled by the s0 parameter in Perseus) were used with a permutation‐based FDR of 0.05 resulting from an s0 of 0.01. For mouse plasma analysis, we used scipy.stats.ttest_ind to calculate t‐test probabilities for the means of two independent samples. This was corrected for an FDR of 0.05 by the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Results were filtered to have both a significant FDR‐corrected P‐value and a minimum log2‐fold change of ± 1.
Shapiro–Wilk test was applied to test normality of each individual protein across all five groups in the human study, and 75–80% of proteins are normally distributed. Levene's test was used to assess the equality of variances for each individual protein calculated for two groups in each of the NAFLD sub‐cohorts. As a result, 95% of the proteins have equal variances. All six proteins reported in this study associated with NAFLD met the assumptions of the tests.
Liver‐specific proteins were annotated according to the Human Protein Atlas, which defines “liver enriched”, “group enriched”, and “liver enhanced” proteins with at least 500% higher mRNA levels in liver compared to all other tissues, at least 500% higher mRNA levels in a group of 2–7 tissues compared to the rest, and at least 500% higher mRNA levels in the liver compared to average levels in all tissues, respectively.
Fold changes between conditions were calculated as Condition A/Condition B ‐1 for protein label‐free (LFQ) intensities. The changes are indicated in percentage (e.g., increased by 62% and decreased by 27%).
