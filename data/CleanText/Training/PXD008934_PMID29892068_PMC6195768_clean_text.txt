ABSTRACT:
Detyrosinated microtubules (MTs) provide mechanical resistance that can impede the motion of contracting cardiomyocytes. However, the functional effects of MT detyrosination in heart failure or in human hearts have not previously been studied. Here we utilize mass spectrometry and single-myocyte mechanical assays to characterize changes to the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and their functional consequences in human heart failure. Proteomic analysis of left ventricle tissue reveals a consistent upregulation and stabilization of intermediate filaments and MTs in failing human hearts. As revealed by super-resolution imaging, failing cardiomyocytes are characterized by a dense, heavily detyrosinated MT network, which is associated with increased myocyte stiffness and impaired contractility. Pharmacological suppression of detyrosinated MTs lowers the viscoelasticity of failing myocytes and restores 40–50% of lost contractile function; reduction of MT detyrosination using a genetic approach also softens cardiomyocytes and improves contractile kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that a modified cytoskeletal network impedes contractile function in cardiomyocytes from failing human hearts and that targeting detyrosinated MTs could represent a new inotropic strategy for improving cardiac function.

ONLINE METHODS
Human myocardial tissue
Procurement of human myocardial tissue was performed under protocols ethical regulations approved by Institutional Review Boards at the University of Pennsylvania and the Gift-of-Life Donor Program (Pennsylvania, USA). Failing human hearts were procured at the time of orthotropic heart transplantation at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania following informed consent from all participants. Non-failing (NF) hearts were obtained at the time of organ donation from cadaveric donors. In all cases, hearts were arrested in situ using ice-cold cardioplegia solution and transported on wet ice. Whole hearts and dissected left ventricle (LV) cavity were weighed to determine levels of hypertrophy. Transmural myocardial samples were dissected from the mid LV free wall below the papillary muscle. LV tissues for mass spectrometry and western blot were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen within 4 hours of explantation. Contractile parameters, including left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), were determined by echocardiography in patients.
Classification standard: NF donor hearts (with an LVEF greater than 50%) are further divided into normal and compensated hypertrophy (cHyp). cHyp is defined by an indexed LV mass (LV mass/body surface area) above 115g/m2 in men and 95g/m2 in women. Failing hearts are etiologically defined by clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is subdivided into HCM with preserved EF (HCMpEF EF>50%) and HCM with reduced EF (HCMrEF EF<50%). Failing hearts with dilated LV chamber size are classified as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and failing hearts with ischemic injury are grouped as ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). A proportion of the failing hearts manifest a combination of mixed ischemic and dilated etiology.
34 hearts in total were used in mass spectrometry (see method details below), including 7 normal, 6 cHyp, 4 HCMpEF, 5 HCMrEF, 6 DCM, 6 ICM. Myocytes were isolated from 22 hearts (see method details below) for functional studies, including 6 normal and 7 cHyp, 9 failing transplants (all hearts with EF<50%, including 6 DCM, 1HCMpEF, 1 HCMrEF, 1 ICM). All data collected from these patients are included in this study. For further details on classification, descriptive statistics and experiments performed on each heart and a summary see Supplementary Table 1.
Human left ventricular myocyte isolation
Hearts received cold, blood-containing, high-potassium cardioplegic solution in vivo. Explanted hearts were transported from the operating suite to the laboratory in cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) solution (12.5 mM glucose, 5.4 mM KCl, 1 mM lactic acid, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 130 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, and 2 mM Na pyruvate, pH 7.4). Myocytes were disaggregated by use of a modification of isolation techniques described previously. Briefly, hearts were weighed and rinsed in KHB. A non-infarcted free wall region of the LV apex was dissected and a small catheter was placed into the lumen of the left ventricular descending (LAD) artery. Major large vessels on the tissue piece were identified by injecting KHB via the cannula and tied by suture knots to improve perfusion via small vessels. Once the tissue was ready for perfusion, it was covered by plastic wrap with pores for outflow, in order to maintain tissue temperature at 37˚C. The cannulated LV tissue was perfused with a non-recirculating Ca2+-free solution (KHB containing 20 mM BDM and 10 mM taurine) for 10–15 minutes until the outflow temperature reached around 37˚C. Then, 200 mL of KHB containing 294 U/mL collagenase, 20 mM BDM and 10 mM taurine was perfused for 3 mins without recirculation and followed by 22–32 mins with recirculation (depending on the cannulation and how fibrotic the tissue was). Ca2+ was introduced stepwise per minute by adding CaCl2 solution up to 1mM, i.e. 4 X 50μM, 4 X 100μM and 2 X 200μM into the recirculated collagenase solution. Then the tissue was perfused for 5 minutes with rinse solution (KHB containing 10 mM taurine, 20 mM BDM, 1 mM CaCl2 and 1% BSA). The tissue was then removed from the cannula, and myocardial tissue was minced in the rinse solution and triturated using glass pipets. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through 280μm nylon mesh (Component supply U-CMN-280), centrifuged (25g for 2 min), and resuspended in rinse solution. The temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout the isolation. Viable cells were enriched by gravity-sedimentation for 5 min, and the resulting loose pellet was transferred to a fresh tube and resuspended in proper amount of normal Tyrode’s (NT) solution for contractility, [Ca2+]i transients and nanoindentation. Cells were also fixed for immunofluorescence (see details below).
Mass Spectrometry of human left ventricular tissues
Sample preparation.
Human left ventricular tissues collected from a myocardial rich, minimally fibrotic region of the mid LV wall were used for mass spectrometry. Tissue was homogenized in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS (Cayman 10010263) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad 5000205). 100 μg protein from each sample was precipitated as previously described. The pellet was resuspended with 8 M urea, 100 mM NH4HCO3, and pH 8.0. Denaturation/reduction was performed in 8 M urea/5 mM dithiothreitol/25 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) for over 60 min in 52°C. The solution was stored at room temperature in 25 mM iodoacetamide at the dark for 60 min. The urea was diluted to a concentration of 1 M with 25 mM NH4HCO3 and then digested with trypsin (1:50 ratio) at 37°C with shaking for 16 hrs. After tryptic digestion, peptide mixture was desalted with C18 micro spin column (C18, Harvard Apparatus, and Holliston, MA). The column was washed with 200 μL of 100 % acetonitrile and equilibrated with 200 μL of loading buffer (0.1 % formic acid). Peptides were loaded onto the column, washed with a loading buffer and eluted with 200 μL of 70 % acetonitrile/ 0.1 % formic acid. All steps for loading, washing, and elution were carried out with benchtop centrifugation (300 x g for 2 min). The eluted samples were dried in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator and reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid.
Nano liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.
Desalted peptides were analyzed on a Q-Exactive (Thermo Scientific) attached to an EasyLC system run at 300 nL/min. Peptides were eluted with a 170 min gradient from 2% to 32% ACN and to 98% ACN over 10 min in 0.1% formic acid. Data dependent acquisition mode with a dynamic exclusion of 45 s was enabled. One full MS scan was collected with scan range of 350 to 1600 m/z, resolution of 70 K, maximum injection time of 50 ms and automatic gain control (AGC) of 1E6. Then, a series of MS2 scans were acquired for the most abundant ions from the MS1 scan (top 12). Ions were filtered with charge 2–4. An isolation window of 2.0 m/z was used with quadruple isolation mode. Ions were fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with collision energy of 27%. Orbitrap detection was used with scan range of 200 to 2000 m/z, resolution of 17.5 K, maximum injection time of 150 ms and automatic gain control of 5E6.
Proteomics MS data analysis including peptide identification and quantification.
MaxQuant version 1.5.3.30 was used to process the raw spectra. The uniprot human database was used for database searching. Default search parameters were used, including precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, fragment mass tolerance of 20 ppm, trypsin cleavage and up to 2 mis-cleavages. Carbamidomethyl [C] was set as fixed modification, while Oxidation [M] was set as variable modifications. The target-decoy approach was used to filter the search results, in which the false discovery rate was less than 1% at the peptide and protein level. LFQ (Label-free quantification) and iBAQ (intensity-based absolute-protein-quantification) were enabled.

Drug treatment
Viable myocytes were concentrated by gravity (5–7min) and supernatant was aspirated to remove dead cells. Myocytes were resuspended in NT solution containing 1mM Ca2+ and concentrated by gravity (5–7min) again. Cardiomyocytes used acutely were maintained in NT solution for up to 6 hours. Myocytes were treated with 10 μΜ parthenolide (Fisher Scientific NC9013142 or Sigma P0667) or 10μΜ colchicine (Sigma) at room temperature in NT solution for 2 hours. Experiments were performed within 6 hours of isolation, except for those involving viral transduction in cultured cells.
NT Solution: NaCl, 140 mM; MgCl2, 0.5 mM; NaH2PO4, 0.33 mM; HEPES, 5 mM; Glucose, 5.5 mM; CaCl2, 1 mM; KCl, 5 mM; NaOH, pH to 7.4.
Cell culture and viral transduction
MatTek glass bottom dish was coated with 5μl of 0.5mg/ml laminin and air dried for 10 min. Culture medium consisted of F-10 (1X) Nutrient Mixture (Ham) [+] L-Glutamine (Life Technologies, 11550–043) supplemented with insulin-transferrin selenium-X (Gibco, 51500–056), 20mM HEPES, 1 μg/μl primocin (Invivogen, ant-pm-1), 0.4mM extra CaCl2, 5% FBS, and 25μM cytochalasin D (Cayman, 11330). Viable myocytes were concentrated and the proper amount of medium was added in culture so that neighboring cells were not in direct contact. Viral constructs were permitted to express for 48 hours with MOI = 100–200. Adenoviral TTL-IRES-dsRed and EMTB-3x GFP were transduced in human myocytes as previously performed in rat myocytes. To recover the maximal contractile function in cultured human myocytes, we found it important to replenish myocytes with fresh warm medium without cytochalasin D prior to calcium and contractility measurements.
Cell contractility
Experiments were performed as previously described with some modification. Contractility was measured in custom-fabricated cell chambers (Ionoptix) mounted on an LSM Zeiss 880 inverted confocal microscope using a 40x oil 1.4 NA objective and transmitted light camera (IonOptix MyoCam-S). Myocytes were maintained in NT solution (for freshly isolated myocytes) or culture medium (without cytochalasin D, for cultured myocytes) at room temperature and electrical field stimulation was provided at 0.5 Hz with a myopacer (IonOptix MYP100) through platinum electrodes lowered into the bath. Sarcomere length was measured optically by Fourier transform analysis (IonWizard, IonOptix). After 10–30s of 0.5 Hz pacing to achieve steady state, five traces were recorded and analyzed. If not specified, contractility data was obtained at room temperature. The number of myocytes and hearts used in each experiments and further details are listed in Supplementary Table 6.
To test whether the contractile improvement with MT destabilization remains under more physiological conditions, both 0.5 Hz and 1Hz contractions at 37˚C were recorded and analyzed in a small subset of isolated human myocytes (1 NF and 1 failing heart, Supplementary Fig. 5c).
Calcium Measurements
Calcium measurements were carried out as previously described with the following modifications. Myocytes were loaded with 1μM Fluo-3-acetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen) and 15% Pluronic F127 (a poloxamer made by BASF, Florham Park, NJ, USA) for 15 minutes. Cells were scanned using a 488-nm argon ion laser in confocal line-scan mode at 0.909 ms/line. Cells were electrically paced at 0.5 Hz at room temperature for 30 s to achieve steady state; five steady-state transients of each myocyte were averaged, pooled in groups and analyzed for calcium transient properties. The measured fluorescence (F) throughout the transient was normalized to the resting fluorescence prior to stimulation (F0) to normalize for heterogeneity in dye loading.
Immunofluorescence (IF)
Cells were fixed in pre-chilled methanol at −20 °C for 7 min. After washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for four times, cells were placed in blocking buffer (Seablock, Abcam ab166951) for 1 hour, then labeled with primary antibodies (below) for 48 hours at 4°C. Cells were then washed 4x in blocking buffer, labeled with secondary antibodies (below) at room temperature and washed 3x in blocking buffer. Stained cells were mounted on mouse laminin (Roche 11243217001) coated #1.5 coverslips (22mm x 22mm, Globe Scientific 1404–15) using Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies P36934) for imaging.
Immunofluorescence on paraffin tissue section
Human left ventricle tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Tissue dehydration (reagent alcohol 70% 60min, 95% 60min x 2, 100% 60min x 3, 37˚C), clearing (xylene 90min x 3, 37˚C), and wax infiltration (110 min and 80 min x 2, 62˚C) was automated in a tissue processor (ThermoScientific Excelsior AS). Tissues were then embedded in paraffin on the embedding station. Five-micron tissue sections were cut on a microtome (ThermoScientific Shandon Finesse 325) and mounted on positive charged glass slides (Globe Scientific 1358A).
Slides were placed in a slide rack and rinsed in xylene 2× 3min for deparaffinization. Tissue sections were re-hydrated in reagent alcohol, 100% 2min x 2, 95% 2min x 2, 70% 2min, ddH2O 2min. Slides were immersed in 1% Tween-20 solution for 5 minutes for permeabilization, then rinsed in diH2O very briefly, and immersed in 100°C antigen retrieval buffer (Tris-EDTA buffer, containing10 mM Tris base, 1 mM EDTA solution, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 9.0.) on a steamer for 40 minutes. Slide chambers with buffer and slides were removed from steamer and allowed to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes. After brief rinses in ddH20, slides were blocked in Seablock for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies (1:50 in blocking buffer) were incubated over 3 nights at 4°C. Sections were rinsed PBS x 3 and labeled with secondary antibodies (1:1000) for 1 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342 (1:1000) for 10 min. Slides were rinsed with PBS x 4, blot dry, and mounted using Prolong Diamond Antifade mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #P36965) for imaging.
Western blotting
For analysis of protein expression levels quantitative western blots (WB) were performed using infrared fluorescence imaging on an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR). Human left ventricular tissue homogenates were prepared in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS (Cayman 10010263) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). In some of the homogenates, lysis buffer also contained protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Cell signaling 5872). Protein concentration was determined by protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of supernatants were mixed with 4x sample buffer (LI-COR, 928–40004) containing 10% BME, boiled for 10 min, and resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tris-glycine gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to a membrane on Mini Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad), blocked 1 hour in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (TBS) (LI-COR, 927–50000), and probed with the corresponding primary antibodies (see list below) overnight at 4˚C. Membranes were then rinsed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween (TBST) 20 4x for 5 min, and incubated with secondary antibodies (below) in TBS supplemented with 0.2% Tween20 for 1 hour at room temperature. Membranes were rinsed again with TBST and then imaged on Odyssey Imager. Image analysis was performed using Image Studio Lite software (LI-COR). GAPDH was used as loading control. We also controlled for variability of different experiments/blots by including 3 reference samples from normal group in every blot. Fluorescent band intensity was normalized to GAPDH. Before pooling data from different blots, the values were again normalized to the average of the 3 reference samples. Analysis was performed blinded to the experimental groups.

Imaging equipment and analysis
Confocal imaging was carried out on a Zeiss 880 laser scanning confocal microscope operating on an Axiovert Z1 inverted microscope equipped with a 40x oil 1.4 NA objective. High-speed super resolution imaging was carried out on a Zeiss 880 Airyscan confocal with a 40× 1.4 oil NA objective. Image analysis was performed using ZEN Black software for Airyscan processing, which involves signal integration from the 32 separate sub-resolution detectors in the Airyscan detector and subsequent deconvolution of this integrated signal. Additional signal processing was performed in Image J (NIH). For calculating the microtubule (MT) fraction of cell area (Fig. 2d), image analysis was performed blinded to the experimental groups. A 2-μm max intensity projection was produced from four 0.5-μm confocal z-sections. The threshold to determine MT positive pixels was determined from the average fluorescence of three background regions that clearly demonstrated no MT staining within the cell. From the resulting binary images (Fig. 2d top), the MT positive fraction of the total cell area was calculated for dTyr-MT and Tyr-MT network (Fig. 2d bottom). Then binary images of both dTyr- and Tyr-MT channels were overlaid to generate a binary image of the total MT network of the cell, which enables the quantification of total-MT area and ratio of dTyr-MT/ total MT (Fig. 2d bottom).
Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) was performed on a Deltavison OMX microscope, equipped with a Front Illuminated sCMOS camera (2560 ×2160 pixels), 6 color solid state illuminator and 100× 1.4NA oil immersion lens powered by a OMX Master Workstation.
Nanoindentation – Stiffness measurements
Mechanical properties at the microscopic scale were measured using nanoindentation (Piuma Chiaro, Optics11, The Netherlands). Freshly isolated human myocytes were attached to glass bottom dishes coated with MyoTak in NT solution (1 mM Ca2+) at room temperature. A spherical nano-indentation probe with a radius of 3.05 µm and a stiffness of 0.026 N/m was used. Myocytes were indented to a depth of 1.5–3.5 µm with velocities of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 50.0, 100.0, and 150.0 μm/s. The tip was held in this indentation depth for 1 s, and retracted over 2 s. The Young׳s moduli were calculated automatically by the software, by fitting the force vs. indentation curve to the Hertz equation. The Young׳s modulus E is derived from the fit of the initial 60% of the loading force-displacement curve (F(h)), the indenter tip radius (R) and indentation depth (h), according to the following formula, for which a Poisson׳s ratio (ν) of 0.5 was assumed.  Number of myocytes and hearts used in this experiment and further details are listed in Supplementary Table 5.
Statistics and Reproducibility
Proteomic analysis and statistics
Mass spectrometry (MS) was performed in multiple hearts (biologically independent samples) for each group (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1a-e). Number of human hearts used (Normal N=7, cHyp N=6, ICM N=6, HCMpEF N=4, HCMrEF N=5, DCM N=6) is stated in figure legends.
LFQ values measured by MS were used to represent the expression levels of proteins. Box plots of sample variance indicate normal distributions in each sample (Supplementary Fig. 1a, box represents upper and lower quantiles, line median and whiskers 1.5 inter quantile range). Duplicated protein entries with lower LFQ values were removed. Also, protein entries with a median LFQ value of 0 were removed to exclude proteins expressed at very low levels or undetected by MS. This resulted in a trimmed list of 2676 proteins, and LFQ values from this list were used to perform principal component analysis (PCA). To obtain a general view of sample distribution among disease conditions and evaluate whether there is biased distribution toward certain gender or age groups, the 500 genes with the highest variance among all samples were input in PCA performed using the FactoMineR R software package. Samples in the PCA plots are color coded by disease groups, age or gender to illustrate any distribution pattern/cluster based on these factors (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1b-e; source data file Supplementary Spreadsheet MS data). To concentrate on difference from the most variable proteins and discover the genes contributing to the difference, a 2D-PCA biplot was generated (Supplementary Fig. 1b). MS Raw data was deposited in PRIDE with dataset identifier PXD008934.
Differential gene expression analysis was used to assess prominent changes in disease groups, resulted in a protein list ranked by statistical significance obtained from LIMMA, an R package with a linear model adjusting for age and sex. P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Fig. 1d top left shows the top 10 upregulated genes in HCMrEF and DCM groups, which is ranked by the adjusted P values from LIMMA analysis. Supplementary Table 2 is a summary of the top 25 up- and down-regulated proteins from differential gene expression analysis. The ranked lists of top 500 upregulated genes in each group (compared to normal) were used for gene list functional enrichment analysis (Toppfun), performed on Toppgene website. The top 20 upregulated molecular function GO groups in each comparison (see Supplementary Table 3) were summarized and then compiled into a list of functionally non-redundant GO groups (with more than 10% hit counts/input list in at least one of the comparisons). This list of GO groups was expressed in a heat map (Fig. 1b) color coded by -log10 q-value B+H (statistical significance obtained from Toppfun analysis). Color coded heat maps based on log2 fold change (Fig. 1c) and dot plots of LFQ values (Fig. 1d) were also made to visualize protein expression shifts in specific cytoskeletal groups/genes of interest among disease groups. Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/) was used to generate heat maps. Results of the domain enrichment analysis are available in Supplementary Table 4.
Other data analysis and statistics
Statistical analysis and graphing were performed using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Values are presented as means ± standard error in line graphs; all dot plots are shown with mean line ± standard deviation with all data points shown; for box and whisker plots, box represents 25th to 75th percentiles, the whiskers 1SD, with median notch and mean line.
For Fig. 2–5 and Supplementary Fig. 1f, Fig.2–6, all experiments were replicated in multiple hearts (biologically independent samples/independent experiments) for each condition, indicated by the N number in each figure and figure legend. The exact n values used to calculate statistics and the statistical tests for significance are stated in individual figure legends. In summary, where comparisons between sets were both repetitive and restricted, the Bonferroni multiple comparisons correction was used to adjust the significance threshold of two-sided T-tests accordingly (Fig. 2d-f, 4f-g, 5a, 5d, 5f; Supplementary Fig. 5c). Multiple comparisons- ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test was used when multiple data sets shared a single control condition (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 1f, 2c-d, 4e-g). Outlier exclusion was applied to immunofluorescence quantification data (Fig. 2d) exceeding 2 standard deviations from the mean. Degrees of freedom for all ANOVA is equal to number of groups minus one (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 1f, 2c-d, 4e-g). Degrees of freedom for all two-sample two-sided T-tests is equal to the combined number of data points (n) minus two (Fig. 2d-f, Fig. 5a,d,f), while degrees of freedom for all one-sample two-sided T-tests is equal to n minus one (Fig. 4f-g, Supplementary Fig. 5c).
