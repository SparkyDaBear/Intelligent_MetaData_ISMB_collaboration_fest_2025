ABSTRACT:
Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria provide the first line of defense against antibiotics and other harmful compounds. LPS biosynthesis critically depends on LpxC catalyzing the first committed enzyme in this process. In Escherichia coli, the cellular concentration of LpxC is adjusted in a growth rate-dependent manner by the FtsH protease making sure that LPS biosynthesis is coordinated with the cellular demand. As a result, LpxC is stable in fast-growing cells and prone to degradation in slow-growing cells. One of the factors involved in this process is the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) but previous studies suggested the involvement of yet unknown factors in LpxC degradation. We established a quantitative proteomics approach aiming at the identification of proteins that are associated with LpxC and/or FtsH at high or low growth rates. The identification of known LpxC and FtsH interactors validated our approach. A number of proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation, including the central regulator FadR, were found in the LpxC and/or FtsH interactomes. Another protein associated with LpxC and FtsH was WaaH, a LPS-modifying enzyme. When overproduced, several members of the LpxC/FtsH interactomes were able to modulate LpxC proteolysis. Our results go beyond the previously established link between LPS and phospholipid biosynthesis and uncover a far-reaching network that controls LPS production by involving multiple enzymes in fatty acid metabolism, phospholipid biosynthesis and LPS modification.

Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Plasmids
All bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. For in vivo degradation experiments, E. coli W3110 containing plasmids from the ASKA collection obtained from the National Bioresource Project, National Institute of Genetics, Japan were used. When appropriate, antibiotics were used at following concentrations: ampicillin (Amp) 100 μg/mL, kanamycin (Kan) 50 μg/mL, chloramphenicol (Cm) 25 μg/mL, spectinomycin (Sp) 300 μg/mL.
LpxC and FtsH Purification
Escherichia coli BL21 Δarg/Δlys cells were incubated in 800 mL LB medium at 180 rpm in a shaking water bath at 30°C (slow growth), 37°C (medium growth) or 40°C (fast growth) to an optical density (OD580 nm) of 0.5. Overproduction of Strep-LpxC (pBO113) or Strep-tag (pASK-IBA5+) were induced by adding 10 ng (30°C), 25 ng (37°C) or 40 ng (40°C) AHT for 30 min and overproduction of His6-MBP-FtsH (pMal-C-FtsH) or His6-MBP (pBO4811) were induced by adding 0.05 mM IPTG for 30 min at 30, 37, or 40°C. Cells were disrupted using the Constant Systems (two cycles, 40 kpsi) and centrifuged for 45 min at 13,200 rpm and 4°C. Strep-LpxC or Strep-tag were purified by Strep-tactin affinity purification (IBA Lifescience, manufacturer protocol) and His6-MBP-FtsH or His6-MBP by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity purification as described previously. Bradford assays were performed to determine the elution fraction with the highest amount of protein.
Preparation of the Super-SILAC Standard
Escherichia coli BL21 Δarg/Δlys were incubated in 500 mL Azure high-def media (Teknova) complemented with L-arginine: HCL (U-13C6, 15N4) (Arg10), L-lysine: 2HCL (13C6, 15N2) (Lys8) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and 1% glucose at 30, 37, and 40°C until reaching an OD580 nm of 0.5. Cells were harvested, pooled, disrupted by using the Constant System (two cycles, 40 kpsi) and centrifuged for 45 min at 13,200 rpm and 4°C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by Bradford assay. The total number of proteins and the labeling efficiency of Arg10 and Lys8 were determined after LC-MS/MS. The labeling efficiency of Arg10 and Lys8 was calculated by using following formula (with l = summed intensity of “light” peptides and h = summed intensity of “heavy” peptides):
Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry
1.5 μg of purified Strep-LpxC or His6-MBP-FtsH were mixed with 1.5 μg of the super-SILAC standard. For Strep-tag or His6-MBP EV controls, the same volume as in the corresponding Strep-LpxC or His6-MBP-FtsH sample was used. Samples were concentrated on a Novex NuPage 4–12% gradient gel until the sample completely entered the gel. Proteins were visualized by colloidal Coomassie staining. Single protein bands were excised and washed with 40 μL of buffer A (10 mM NH4HCO3 in A. dest.) and 40 μL buffer B [buffer A in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN)]. Samples were evaporated in a vacuum concentrator. Dry gel pieces were digested using 5 μL of 2.0 μg/μL trypsin in 10 mM HCl and 55 μL of 100 mM NH4HCO3 overnight at 37°C. Peptides were extracted by incubating each sample in 20 μL 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/100% ACN (v/v = 1:1) in A. dest. twice for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath. The remaining ACN was removed by evaporation and 15 μL 0.1% TFA was added to the sample prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.
For peptide separation and identification an UltiMate®3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Elite hybrid ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. 15 μL of the peptide sample was enriched and desalted on an Acclaim®PepMapTM C18 μ-precolumn (5 μm particle size, 2 cm length, 100 μm ID, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 95% solvent A [0.1% (v/v) TFA in A. dest.] and 5% solvent B [0.1% (v/v) TFA, 50% (v/v) ACN in A. dest.] with a flow rate of 30 μL/min for 7 min. Peptides were subsequently separated on an Acclaim®PepMapTM C18 analytical column (2 μm particle size, 50 cm length, 75 μm ID, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 95% solvent C [0.1% (v/v) formic acid (FA) in A. dest.] and 5% solvent D [0.1% (v/v) FA, 84% (v/v) ACN in A. dest.]. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 400 nL/min using a linear gradient of 5–40% solvent D over 120 min. Eluting peptides were injected in the mass spectrometer and a Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) scan in a mass/charge range between 300 and 2,000 with a resolution of 60,000 was performed. For MS/MS, the 20 most intense peptide ions (Top20 method) of the FTMS scan with a minimal signal intensity of 1,500 and a charge range >+2 were selected and fragmented by CID with a collision energy of 35%. The inclusion list size was set to 500 and the exclusion duration time to 35 s.
Data Analysis
For quantitative analysis of high-resolution MS data, MaxQuant (Version 1.5.0.0, Max-Planck-Institute Martinsried) was used, which is based on the search algorithm Andromeda. All samples were processed together and parameters were set as follows: “Digestion Mode” = specific with enzyme Trypsin/P No “Fixed Modifications” were considered. “Variable modification” = oxidation of methionine, “Multiplicity” = 2, “Heavy labels” = Arg10 and Lys8, “Max. missed cleavages” = 2, “MS tolerance” = 20 ppm, “MS/MS tolerance” = 0.5 Da, “False discovery rate” (FDR) = 0.01, “Re-quantify” = checked, “Randomize” = decoy mode, “Minimal ratio count” = 1, “Match between runs” = unchecked, “iBAQ” = checked, “Include contaminants” = checked, “Cut peaks” = checked, “discard unmodified counterparts peptides” = unchecked. The E. coli reference proteome database (“ecoprot.lib” download from Uniprot, April, 4th, 2013, 4145 entries) was supplemented with the sequences of His6-MBP and Strep-tag and used to identify peptides and proteins. The taxonomy was set to “E. coli.” Only unique peptides were used for quantification. If not stated otherwise, default parameters in MaxQuant were used. Known contaminants were excluded. H/L ratios calculated by MaxQuant have been used.
In vivo Degradation Using a Double Expression System
Escherichia coli W3110 cells containing a plasmid from the ASKA collection and the lpxC expression plasmid (pBO4804) were grown at 37°C and 180 rpm in a water bath shaker until an OD580 nm of 0.5. The main culture was split into two subcultures. Expression of lpxC was induced in one subculture by adding 0.1% arabinose for 10 min and the gene of choice (ASKA collection) by adding 0.1–0.5 mM IPTG for 10–30 min. Only lpxC was overexpressed in the other subculture as a control. Translation was inhibited by adding 300 μg/mL Sp and samples were taken at different time points and frozen into liquid nitrogen. At least three biological replicates were analyzed.
Sample Preparation and Immunodetection
Cell pellets were resuspended in TE-buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA) in an OD580 nm-dependent manner (OD580 nm of 1.0 = 100 μL TE-buffer) and protein sample buffer [final concentration: 2% SDS (w/v), 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8] was added. The samples were incubated for 10 min at 95°C and centrifuged. Proteins in the supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane according. LpxC was detected using the rabbit-α-Strep-tag-LpxC antibody followed by the goat-α-rabbit (H+L)-HRP conjugate (Bio-Rad) antibody. His6-tag fusion proteins were detected by using a Penta-His-HRP conjugate (Qiagen). Chemiluminescence signals were detected using Luminata Forte Western HRP substrate (Millipore) and the ChemiDocTM MP System (Bio-Rad). LpxC half-lives were calculated by using the software ImageJ (version 1.491).
