ABSTRACT:
Exit of metastasizing tumor cells from the vascular system is regulated by their dynamic interactions with the endothelial cells that line the internal surface of vessels. While extravasation is a key event within the metastatic cascade, the signals controlling tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium and their subsequent transendothelial migration are poorly understood. By combining Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) and phosphoproteomic analysis, we mapped cell-specific changes in protein phosphorylation that were triggered by contact between breast cancer cells and endothelial cells. From the 2,669 unique phosphorylation sites identified, 77 and 43 were differentially phosphorylated in the tumor cells and endothelial cells, respectively. Among the phospho-regulated proteins within the tumor cells, the receptor tyrosine kinase Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EPHA2) was found to inhibit transendothelial migration of breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that this was dependent on EPHA2-Tyr772 phosphorylation, which was decreased in the breast cancer cells upon endothelial contact. Importantly, comparison of isogenic breast cancer cell lines with different metastatic capacities revealed that EPHA2-Tyr772 dephosphorylation was specifically associated with higher lung metastatic potential. Altogether, our cell-specific phosphoproteomic analysis provides the first bidirectional map of contact-initiated signaling between tumor and endothelial cells, which has led to the characterization of a novel EPHA2-based regulatory mechanism of transendothelial migration.

MDA-MB-468 and SUM149PT cell lines were a kind gift from Rachel Natrajan (The Institute of Cancer Research), MDA-MB-453 cells were a kind gift from Jorge Reis-Filho (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) pooled were purchased from Promocell, and EA.hy926 cells were from ATCC.
Tissue culture
MDA-MB-231 (Parental, LM2, BrM2a and BoM1), MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, EA.hy926 and HEK 293FT cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium DMEM (41966-052) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotic/antimycotic solution. SUM149PT cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (31331-028) supplemented with 5% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 5 µg/mL insulin, 1 µg/mL hydrocortisone (H0888) and antibiotic/antimycotic solution. HUVECs were cultured in medium 199 GlutaMAX (41150-087) supplemented with 20% FBS, 0.01 mg/mL heparin (H3393), 50 µg/mL endothelial cell growth supplement (AbD Serotec 4110-5004) and antibiotic/antimycotic solution. They were grown on tissue culture dishes, coated with 0.1% gelatin (G1890) and kept in culture for a maximum of 7 passages. All cells were grown in humidified incubators at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells from non-commercial sources were authenticated by STR profiling. All cell line stocks were routinely tested to confirm the absence of mycoplasma with e-Myco Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (iNtRON 25235).
SILAC labeling
Basal SILAC medium, pH 7.2, was made up from sodium bicarbonate and DMEM or RPMI deficient in L-arginine and L-lysine (Caisson Labs DMP49 and RPP21 respectively) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For labeling cells, basal SILAC medium was supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, antibiotic/antimycotic solution and isotopomeric versions of L-lysine and L-arginine, each at a final concentration of 50 µg/mL. Isotopomeric versions of amino acids for SILAC labeling were all supplied by Sigma-Aldrich: L-arginine-13C6,15N4 hydrochloride (Arg+10 Da) (608033) and L-lysine-13C6,15N2 hydrochloride (Lys+8 Da) (608041) were used for heavy-labeling; L-arginine-13C6 hydrochloride (Arg+6 Da) (643440) and L-lysine-4,4,5,5-d4 hydrochloride (Lys+4 Da) (616192) were used for medium-labeling; and L-arginine (A8094) and L-lysine (L5501) were used for light-labeling. LM2 cells were grown for a minimum of 6 passages in DMEM-based SILAC labeling media before use in co-culture experiments. For SILAC labeling of HUVECs, RPMI-based SILAC medium was conditioned for 16 hours with fully labeled immortalized human endothelial cells EA.hy926. Conditioned medium was sterile filtered, diluted 1:1 with fresh RPMI SILAC medium, and supplemented with heparin and endothelial cell growth supplement. HUVECs were grown for two passages in conditioned SILAC media before use in co-culture experiments. Labeling efficiency of LM2 cells and HUVECs was assessed for a minimum of 3 independent cell cultures for each label.
SILAC co-culture for analysis of contact-initiated signaling
HUVECs were grown to confluent monolayers in 15 cm dishes. Prior to co-culture, confluent monolayers of HUVECs were serum-starved for 1.5 hours and a reserved dish of HUVECs was used for counting. To study the LM2 cells phosphoproteome, fully labeled LM2 cells (~70% confluency) were serum-starved for 16 hours, harvested with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer and washed twice in serum-free, basal SILAC DMEM before counting. Heavy-labeled LM2 cells (Arg+10/Lys+8) were plated onto light-labeled HUVECs in a 2:1 LM2:HUVECs cell ratio in a volume of 3 mL per dish. Medium-labeled LM2 cells (Arg+6/Lys+4) were collected and kept in suspension in parallel to the co-culture. Cells were incubated for 15 min at 37°C, 5% CO2. After incubation, unattached cells were removed from the dishes and counted to estimate the number of LM2 cells remaining attached to HUVEC monolayers. Heavy-labeled LM2 cells and HUVECs were lysed with medium-labeled LM2 cells in a 1:1 heavy:medium cell ratio with ice-cold 0.1 M Na2CO3 pH 11, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340), phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (P0044) and 10 mM sodium orthovanadate (S6508). To investigate the endothelial cells phosphoproteome, the same protocol for co-culture and cell lysis was followed using heavy- and medium-labeled HUVECs with light-labeled LM2 in a 2:1 LM2:HUVECs cell ratio.
Sample preparation and phosphoproteomic analysis
Membrane fractionation and sample preparation were adapted from. Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. MgCl2 was added to 1 mM final concentration for DNA digestion with Benzonase (Novagen 70746) for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4°C to separate soluble proteins from membrane-associated proteins (pellet). Pellets were washed twice by two rounds of resuspension in lysis buffer followed by 30 min centrifugation before resuspension in 6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC). Protein concentrations of both cytoplasmic and membrane-enriched fractions were assessed by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Reduction, alkylation and digestion were performed by Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP; Vivacon 10 K) with 1 mg total protein per unit. After buffer exchange to 40 mM ABC, proteins were reduced in 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 40 mM ABC for 45 min and subsequently alkylated in 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 50 min in the dark at room temperature. Following, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and samples were incubated with sialidase A / NANase III (Europa Bioproducts PZGK80040) and PNGase F (New England Biolabs P0704) overnight at 37°C to remove sialylations and N-glycosylations. Digestion was performed with Lys-C (Wako 125-05061) (1% w:w enzyme:substrate) for 3 hours at 37°C, followed by addition of trypsin (Worthington) (1% w:w enzyme:substrate) for overnight digestion. Digested peptides were recovered by collecting the flow-through and subsequent washes of the FASP column membrane in ABC, and then 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 50% acetonitrile (MeCN). Recovered peptides were dried under vacuum in a Savant SC250 express SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Scientific).
All phosphopeptide enrichments were conducted as described in. Dried peptide pellets were resuspended in TiO2 loading buffer (80% MeCN, 5% TFA, 1 M glycolic acid) and 3 mg Titansphere TiO2 beads (10 µm; GL-Sciences 5020 75010) were added per 500 µg peptides for 15 min shaking incubation at room temperature. Beads were then sequentially washed with i) loading buffer; ii) 80% MeCN, 1% TFA; and iii) 10% MeCN, 0.2% TFA. Phosphopeptides were eluted by two incubations with 1% ammonium hydroxide, pH 11.3. The flow through was then subjected to two more TiO2 enrichment steps and the three elutions were pooled. Samples were acidified with a mix of TFA / Formic acid (FA), desalted with OLIGO R3 micro-columns packed in-house, and dried under vacuum.
For intra-experiment normalization based on global protein H/M ratios, samples of digested cell lysate prior to phospho-enrichment were fractionated and analyzed in parallel.
Discovery LC-MS/MS of phosphopeptide enriched samples
Samples were resuspended in 0.1% FA and run on a LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a cHiPLC-Nanoflex chromatography system (Eksigent). Reversed-phase chromatographic separation was carried out on a 200 μm inner diameter (i.d.) x 0.5 mm trap column packed with C18 (3 μm bead size, 120 A°, Eksigent), a 75 μm i.d. x 15 cm column packed with C18 (3 μm bead size, 120 A°, Eksigent) with a linear gradient of 5-50% solvent B (100% MeCN + 0.1% FA) against solvent A (100% H2O + 0.1% FA) with a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode. Survey scans were performed in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400 and a Fourier Transform target value of 106 ions. The 10 most abundant ions were selected for fragmentation by higher-energy collisional dissociation and scanned in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 7,500 at m/z 400. Selected ions were dynamically excluded for 8 s. For accurate mass measurement, the lock mass option was enabled using the polydimethylcyclosiloxane ion (m/z 455.120025) as an internal calibrant. For peptide identification, raw data files produced in Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific) were processed in Proteome Discoverer V1.3 (Thermo Scientific) and searched using Mascot (v2.2). Searches were performed with a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, a fragment mass tolerance of 0.05 Da, and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Static modifications were limited to carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and variable modifications used were SILAC labels (Lys+4.025 Da; Lys+8.050 Da; Arg+6.020 Da; Arg+10.008 Da); oxidation of methionine; deamidation of asparagine and glutamine; and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The database used for searching was SwissProt (04/2013, number of entries 89601). Peptides were further filtered using a Mascot significance threshold < 0.05 and a False Discovery Rate < 0.01 (q-value from Percolator 1).
Quantitative analysis of phosphorylation site regulation
For relative phosphopeptide quantification, heavy/medium ratios were determined by Proteome Discoverer (1.3) All further data analysis was performed using the statistical package R (R Development Core Team, 2012; http://www.R-project.org/). Log2(heavy/medium) ratios (log2(H/M)) were compiled for each quantified phosphopeptide and normalized to the median of the log2(H/M) value of the input samples, not subjected to phospho-enrichment. Peptide phospho-positions were filtered based on a phosphoRS site probability > 60%, where only the best scoring peptide was kept before mapping the position on the protein sequence. UniProt entry names are used in the text and figures to refer to identified proteins. Corresponding UniProt Accessions are listed in tables S1, S2, S3 and S4, and more information can be found on http://www.uniprot.org. One of the identified regulated phosphopeptides could not be uniquely attributed to either CAP-Gly domain-containing linker protein 1 (CLIP1) or 2 (CLIP2) due to sequence similarity and has thus been referred to as “CLIP1/2-S348” (with Ser348 in CLIP1 corresponding to Ser352 in CLIP2). Phosphopeptides containing multiply phosphorylated residues have been referenced with all sites featuring phosphorylation (i.e. “AHNK-S210-S212-S216” which is phosphorylated on Ser210, Ser212 and Ser216). Spectra were manually assessed to remove mixed spectra, unresolved extracted ion chromatograms, and low SILAC signal intensity to avoid erroneous quantification before further analysis. Phosphorylation sites were then considered regulated if their average log2(H/M) was above 0.5 or under -0.5. For each regulated phosphorylation site quantified in a minimum of two independent experiments, an unpaired two-sided t-test was performed (α = 0.05). Significant results based on these criteria are referred to as the “core” set of regulated phosphorylation sites.
Fractionation and LC-MS for quantitative analysis of cellular proteome
Peptide samples were prepared as described above without deglycosylation step. High pH reverse phase chromatographic separation was performed on a Agilent Zorbax 300 extend – C18 column (4.6 X 150 mm, 3.5 μm) using a 21 min stepped linear gradient of 0.5-40% solvent B (acetonitrile) against solvent A (H2O; 0.1% NH2O) and 40-85% solvent B against solvent A with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Individual 10 second fractions were collected from 3 to 34 min. The 186 resulting fractions were pooled with equidistance across the gradient (checkboard) into 19 final fractions for LC-MS analysis.
Samples were run on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano system (Thermo Scientific). Reverse phase chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 PepMap 300 Å trap cartridge (0.3mm i.d. x 5 mm, 5 μm bead size; loaded in a bi-directional manner), a 75 μm i.d. x 50 cm column (5 μm bead size) using a 120 min linear gradient of 0-50% solvent B (acetonitrile; 0.1% formic acid) against solvent A (H2O; 0.1% FA) with a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode to automatically switch between Orbitrap MS and MS/MS acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra (from m/z 400-2000) were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 400 and FT target value of 1 x 106 ions. The 10 most abundant ions were selected for fragmentation using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and dynamically excluded for 30 seconds. Fragmented ions were scanned in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 400. For peptide identification, raw data files were produced in Xcalibur 2.1 (Thermo Scientific) and processed in Proteome Discoverer V1.4 (Thermo Scientific). Searches against SwissProt human database using Mascot (v2.2) were performed with settings and filters as described above, including only peptide ion Scores >20 and unique, proteotypic peptides. For relative protein quantification, the threshold intensity for calculating SILAC ratio was set to the 5% quantile for each sample. For proteins quantified in 3 or more independent experiments, the relative log2(heavy/medium) ratios of their 3 most intense peptides were averaged to obtain the protein relative quantity between the heavy and medium channels for each experiment.
siRNA knockdown
Primary RNAi experiments were performed using siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA (Thermo Scientific). Secondary validation of silencing phenotypes was conducted with individual siRNA oligonucleotides of siGENOME or ON-TARGETplus design (Thermo Scientific), or pooled siRNA from FlexiTube GeneSolution (QIAGEN). Details of individual siRNA sequences as well as non-targeting/negative control siRNA used for normalization and statistical comparisons are provided as supplementary information (tables S6 and S7). Transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were transfected with siRNA at a final concentration of 10 nM (siGENOME), 15 nM (QIAGEN) or 25 nM (ON-TARGETplus) 72 hours prior to assaying the impact of silencing.
Tumor-endothelial cell adhesion assay
Cancer cells were detached with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer, washed and resuspended in medium 199, 20% FBS before 1 x 105 cancer cells were plated onto HUVEC monolayers that had been grown to confluency in a 96-well plate. Cells were co-cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30 min (unless otherwise specified), before wells were washed to remove unattached cells. The remaining adherent cancer cells were quantified by the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luminescence was measured on a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader and mean signal intensity was calculated from four replicate wells for each condition. Luminescence of adhering cells was normalized to luminescence from control wells containing the starting number of cancer cells that were plated in parallel.
Transendothelial migration assay
Cancer cells were detached with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer, washed and resuspended in medium 199 GlutaMAX, 2.5% FBS at 5 x 105 cells/mL. 5 x 104 tumor cells were seeded onto HUVEC monolayers, grown to confluency in the upper chambers of 6.5 mm Transwell inserts with 8.0 μm pore polycarbonate membrane (Corning). Lower chambers were filled with 600 μL medium 199, 20% FBS to establish a FBS gradient. Cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 8 hours before transwells were emptied and washed with PBS. Cells on the lower surface of the transwell membrane were detached with trypsin and collected by centrifugation. FBS was added to neutralize trypsin before collected cancer cells were quantified by luciferase assay, measured on a VICTOR X5 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer). Mean signal intensity was calculated from four technical replicates of each condition and normalized to luminescence from control wells containing the starting number of cancer cells that were plated in parallel.
In vivo lung retention assay
All animal work was conducted in accordance with UK Home Office guidelines, as established in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, under project license PPL70/7413. No adverse events were observed during the experiments. Cancer cells for in vivo assay were pre-stained for 45 min with CellTracker dyes made up in serum-free media to a final concentration of 8 μM. “Experimental” cells, transfected with siRNA (EPHA2 or non-targeting control), were stained with CellTracker Green CMFDA dye. In parallel, non-transfected cells were stained with CellTracker Orange CMRA to serve as an “injection control”. Stained cells were allowed to recover in normal growth medium for 6 hours before harvesting using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. Experimental (green) cells were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with injection control (orange) cells. Cell mixes were analyzed on a BD LSRII flow cytometer to verify starting green/orange cell ratios for subsequent normalization of acquired data. Twelve Female CD-1 nude mice (Charles River), aged between 6-8 weeks old, were injected in the tail vein with 8 x 105 cells in a volume of 100 μL PBS (6 animals/group). After 20 hours, mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and whole lungs were excised. Lungs were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS and imaged on a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope under a 20x objective with pinhole diameter set to 1 AU. Images were taken at a 512x512 resolution as 3x3 tiles (1,024 μm2), randomly selected on both sides of each lung to give a total of 10 fields of view per lung. Fluorescent cell area quantification was performed using Volocity Image Analysis Software (PerkinElmer).
Identifying expressed ephrins in HUVECs
To identify ligands of EPHA2 from the HUVEC lysate, HUVECs were grown to confluent monolayers and lysed in PLC buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaPPi, 10% glycerol and 1% Triton X-100; supplemented with sodium orthovanadate, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails). Affinity pull-downs were performed with a recombinant EphA2-Fc chimera (R&D Systems 639-A2-200), using 1-2 μg bait per 500 μg protein lysate. Samples were rotated overnight at 4°C before complexes were captured on Protein A-Sepharose 4B (P9424). Parallel pull-downs were performed using an Fc fragment to control for identification of non-specific interactants. To ensure biological reproducibility, pull-downs were performed with 4 independently cultured samples of HUVECs. Proteins isolated on sepharose beads were separated by SDS-PAGE for in-gel digestion as previously described. Digestions were carried out with either 100 ng sequence-grade trypsin (Promega) or 250 ng AspN (P3303) overnight at 37°C. Extracted peptides were pooled and dried for discovery LC-MS/MS analysis, as described above.
Blocking native EPHA2-ephrin-A1 interactions
Cancer cells were harvested by enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer and incubated for 45 min on ice with non-clustered, recombinant ephrin-A1-Fc chimera (R&D Systems) at a concentration of 3 μg per 106 cells. As a negative control, cells were separately treated in parallel with IgG Fc (Bethyl Laboratories). Cells were washed to remove excess ligand/antibody before use in in vitro cellular assays. For verifying surface localization of ephrin-A1-EPHA2 complexes, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes before washing and staining with Goat IgG DyLight 650 conjugate antibody (Thermo Scientific SA510121; 2.5 μL/106 cells) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted on a BD LSR II flow cytometer and FlowJo vX 10.0.7 (TreeStar Inc) software.
To test blockade of EPHA2 ligand binding sites, soluble ephrinA1-Fc was made up in PBS and 50 μL was added to wells of a 96-well plate to provide a 2 μg/cm2 coating per well. The plate was coated at 37 °C for 2 hours before wells were washed with cold PBS and blocked with a PBS/1% BSA solution for 1 hour at 37 °C. Wells were washed with medium prior to adhesion assay.
Cloning
For generation of luciferase-expressing cancer cell lines, a bicistronic expression construct encoding luciferase and EGFP was created by excising and subcloning the luciferase reporter gene from pCLucf (Addgene 37328) into pcDNA3.1 (+) zeo-IRES-EGFP (gift from Beatrice Howard, The Institute of Cancer Research) using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. Human EPHA2-Y772F in vector pTargeT (gift from Anton Bennett, Yale University) was PCR-amplified with a forward primer containing a HindIII restriction site (5’-TGACAAAGCTTATGGAGCTCCAGGCAGC-3’) and a reverse primer containing a XhoI site (5’-ATCTGAACTCGAGTCAGATGGGGATCCCCAC-3’) for subcloning into vector pcDNA3 at the HindIII-XhoI sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate an EPHA2 K646M mutant expression construct using a QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, according the manufacturer’s instructions. Human wild type EPHA2 in vector pcDNA3 (kind gift from Dr. Tony Pawson) was used a template for PCR with mutagenesis primers 5’-GTGCCGGTGGCCATCATGACGCTGAAAGCC-3’ and 5’-GGCTTTCAGCGTCATGATGGCCACCGGCAC-3’. The pcDNA3-EPHA2-Y772F and pcDNA3-EPHA2-K646M constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.
Transfections and generations of stable cell lines
All transfections with cDNA were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lines transfected for luciferase/GFP expression were grown under Zeocin selection and high luciferase-expressing cells were isolated as GFPhigh populations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on a BD FACS Aria flow cytometer.
Luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453 cells were transfected with constructs for expression of wild-type EPHA2 (EPHA2-WT) (kind gift from Dr Tony Pawson), mutant EPHA2-Y772F or pcDNA3 vector control (Invitrogen) and grown under selection by G418 (A1720). Resistant colonies were pooled to create polyclonal populations for each cell line. Stably transfected cells were stained with mouse anti-EPHA2-Phycoerythrin (PE) conjugate [371805] (R&D Systems FAB3035P) at 8 µL/106 cells, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were counterstained with 0.2 μg/mL DAPI to discern live cells before cell populations were isolated by FACS based on their quantity of EPHA2 at the surface.
Targeted analysis of EPHA2 abundance by mass spectrometry
Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) was used to analyze the expression of wild-type EPHA2 or mutant EPHA2-Y772F in cell lines (figs. S1E and S7). Total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and gel bands at 130 kDa molecular weight were excised for in-gel digestion and targeted analysis by LC-MS as previously described. Characteristic peptides and transitions monitored for EPHA2 and EPHA2-Y772F are provided as supplementary information (see table S8). Raw data files produced in Xcalibur were analyzed using Skyline v2.1 (MacCoss Lab of Biological Mass Spectrometry).
Relative peptide abundance was determined by summing the area under the curve from extracted ion chromatograms of at least three transitions. Abundance of EPHA2 was deduced from the total SRM signal intensity of three quantotypic peptides. For relative comparison of EPHA2 quantity in LM2 and parental MDA-MB-231 cell populations, LM2 and parental cells were SILAC labeled with medium and heavy amino acids, respectively, to allow simultaneous SRM analysis of both populations. Total intensity of EPHA2 peptides was normalized to total protein quantities in each cell population.
For relative quantification of EPHA2 in the LM2 from SILAC-based co-culture experiments, lysates were incubated with an antibody recognizing human EPHA2 (Santa Cruz sc-924; 1 μg antibody per 500 μg protein) under rotation at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-conjugated Sepharose was washed and equilibrated in PLC buffer before addition to complexes for a further rotation of 1-2 hours to immunoprecipitate EPHA2. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed in PLC buffer before isolated complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE for in-gel digest, discovery LC-MS/MS analysis and total protein relative quantification as described above. Normalization was carried out on based on the log2(H/M) ratio of the input samples prior to EPHA2-enrichment.
In vitro kinase activity assay
HEK 293FT cells were transfected with pcDNA3 expression vectors for EPHA2-WT, EPHA2-Y772F, EPHA2-K646M or empty vector control and grown for 48 hours before lysis in PLC buffer. EPHA2 antibody (sc-924) was conjugated onto MagReSyn beads (ReSyn Biosciences MR-PRA002) with overnight rotation at 4°C. Immunoprecipitation of EPHA2 was carried out using 0.5 μg antibody per 500 μg protein lysate. The kinase reaction was carried out as described previously with minor modifications. Briefly, the beads-EPHA2 complexes were washed twice in the Kinase Reaction buffer (KRB; 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM Na3VO4 and 100 μM ATP) before incubation in 30 μL KRB supplemented with 5 μg human α-Enolase (SRP6109) for 1 hour at room temperature. Supernatants were collected and transferred onto a plate for the kinase activity readout using an ADP-Glo kit (Promega V9101), according to manufacturer’s instructions.
EPHA2 stimulation with ephrin-A1
Cancer cells at ~70% confluency in 6-well plates, were serum-starved overnight before stimulation with artificially clustered ephrin-A1. Clustered ligand was freshly prepared by mixing ephrin-A1-Fc with antibody recognizing human IgG Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch 109-001-008-JIR) in a 1:1.2 μg ratio with rotation for a minimum of 1 hour at 4°C. Clustered ephrin-A1 was made up to 2 μg/mL in serum-free media and 700 μL was used to stimulate each well of cancer cells. After incubation with ephrin-A1 at 37°C, 5% CO2 for specified time points, cells were washed and lysed for western blot analysis.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed on ice in PLC buffer and equal amounts of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE before transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (LI-COR 92631092) by a wet transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in Roti-Block (Carl Roth A151.2) for 30 min at room temperature before probing for target proteins. Primary antibodies used in this study were mouse β-ACTIN [AC-15] (Abcam ab6276; 1/5,000), rabbit GAPDH [FL-335] (Santa Cruz sc-25778; 1/2,000), rabbit EPHA2 [C-20] (Santa Cruz sc-924; 1/1,000), rabbit phospho-EPHA2 (Tyr772) (Cell Signalling Technology #8244S; 1/1,000), rabbit phospho-EPHA2 (Tyr588) (Cell Signalling Technology #12677; 1/1,000), rabbit phospho-EPHA2 (Ser897) (Cell Signalling Technology #6347; 1/1,000), and rabbit LMW-PTP (Abcam ab166896; 1/2,000). IRDye-conjugated anti-Rabbit IgG, DyLight 800 (Cell Signalling Technology #5151) and anti-Mouse IgG, DyLight 680 (Cell Signalling Technology #5470) were used as secondary antibodies at 1/15,000.
