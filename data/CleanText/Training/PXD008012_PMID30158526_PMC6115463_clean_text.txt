ABSTRACT:
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks prognostic and predictive markers. Here, we use high-throughput phosphoproteomics to build a functional TNBC taxonomy. A cluster of 159 phosphosites is upregulated in relapsed cases of a training set (n = 34 patients), with 11 hyperactive kinases accounting for this phosphoprofile. A mass-spectrometry-to-immunohistochemistry translation step, assessing 2 independent validation sets, reveals 6 kinases with preserved independent prognostic value. The kinases split the validation set into two patterns: one without hyperactive kinases being associated with a >90% relapse-free rate, and the other one showing ≥1 hyperactive kinase and being associated with an up to 9.5-fold higher relapse risk. Each kinase pattern encompasses different mutational patterns, simplifying mutation-based taxonomy. Drug regimens designed based on these 6 kinases show promising antitumour activity in TNBC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In summary, the present study elucidates phosphosites and kinases implicated in TNBC and suggests a target-based clinical classification system for TNBC.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks prognostic and predictive markers. Here, the authors use phosphoproteomics to define kinases with distinct activity profiles in TNBC, demonstrating their prognostic value as well as their utility for simplifying TNBC classification and designing drug regimens.
METHODS:
Methods
Patient tumor samples
Samples from the training and validation set were gathered through the Spanish National Biobank Network. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional review board approval was obtained at the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (study number: CEI PI 30-2010). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. None of the patients received neoadjuvant therapy prior to biopsy or were BRCA-1 deficient.
Cell lines
A panel of human triple negative breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, Hs578T, MDA-MB-468, HCC1937, HCC1143, HCC38, BT549, BT483, and MDA-MB-415) was acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were maintained following the ATCC recommendations. Luminescent cell lines were generated by stable transfection with a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase (pGL.4.51 luciferase reporter vector, Promega). All cell lines were confirmed to be mycoplasma negative by MycoalertTM Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).
Colony assays
Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and Hs-578T cell lines were seeded at a density of 200, 2000 and 2000 cells per well respectively in 12-well plates. After overnight incubation, drugs were added to the tissue-culture media. Media was replaced every 5 days. After 10 days of culture, cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet in 10% (v/v) ethanol. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Kinase assays
Kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min using specific kinases buffer. Recombinant P70 S6Kinase (1-421, TA412E, Millipore) was incubated with recombinant IRS2 (H8660-Q01, Abnova) or RPS6 (H6194-P01, Abnova) in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris–HCL pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium ortovanadate, 0.4 mM PMSF, 20 mM glicerphsphate) in the presence of 50 μM cold ATP and 1.5 uCi [32 P] ATP. CDK6/Cyclin D3 complexes (14-519, Millipore) in 10 mM MOPS/NaOH pH7, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% B-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM Magnesium acetate were incubated with WEE1 (H7465-P01, Abnova), HSF1-11R (hTF-0070, LD Biopharma) or RUNX1 (hTF-0380, LD Biopharma) in the presence of 100 μM cold ATP and 2 uCi [32 P] ATP. Recombinant PKCE kinase (P2282, Thermofisher) was incubated with recombinant IRS2 or RPS6 in the following kinase buffer (60 mM HEPES-NaOH pH7.5, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM MnCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 4 mM EDTA, 3 μM Na-orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml phosphatidilserine, 1 ug diacylglycerol, 1.2 mM DTT, 50 μg/ml PEG20000 in the presence of 50 μM cold ATP and 1.5 μCi [32 P] ATP. In all cases, reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Radioactive samples were subject to acrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by gel drying and autoradiography.
The samples were then prepared for proteomic analysis as follows: proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin using the standard procedure. Briefly, bands were de-stained with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile solution, reduced with 15 mM TCEP at 45 °C for 60 min and subsequently alkylated with 30 mM chloro-acetamide at RT for 45 min. Digestion was performed overnight with a trypsin solution (6.25 ng/mL) at 37 °C. Supernatant was collected and peptides were further extracted from the gel plugs with 5% TFA. Resulting peptides were desalted using home-made C18 stage-tips.
Finally, we detected the phosphorylated peptides by mass spectrometry. LC–MS/MS was done by coupling an UltiMate 3000 HPLC system to a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded into a trap column Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 C18 LC Columns 5 µm, 20 mm length) for 3 min at a flow rate of 10 µl/min in 0.1% FA. Then peptides were transferred to an analytical column (PepMap RSLC C18 2 µm, 75 µm×50 cm) and separated using a 60 min effective curved gradient (buffer A: 0.1% FA; buffer B: 100% ACN, 0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 250 nL/min from 2 to 35% of buffer B. Peptides were electrosprayed (1.9 kV) using an EasySpray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific), a heated capillary (250 °C) and S-Lens RF level of 60%. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode, with an automatic switch between MS (350–1500 m/z) and MS/MS (fixed first mass 100 m/z) scans using a top 15 method and a dynamic exclusion of 25 s. MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 70,000 and 17,500 FWHM (measured at 200 m/z) respectively. Peptides were isolated using a 2.0 Th window and fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy of 27. The ion target values were 3E6 for MS (25 ms max injection time) and 1E5 for MS/MS (45 ms max injection time). For very faint bands, maximum injection times were increased to 90 ms (AGC value = 5E4).
Raw files were processed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Sequest HT against a human protein database (UniProtKB 20,558 sequences) supplemented with contaminants. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification whereas oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine, theronine and tyrosine as variable modifications. Minimal peptide length was set to 6 amino acids and a maximum of two tryptic missed-cleavages were allowed. Precursor tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion tolerance to 0.025 Da. Results were filtered at 0.01 FDR using Percolator. Abundances of phosphopeptides were calculated using the extracted ion chromatograms (with a 10 ppm window around the M + 0 isotope peak for 30 s before and after the peptide’s MS/MS). In addition, phosphopeptide abundances were normalized by total protein abundance, which was estimated based on non-phosphopeptides. To this end, raw files were also processed with MaxQuant 1.5.7.4 using the standard settings against a human protein database (UniProtKB 20,585 sequences) supplemented with contaminants. Label-free quantification was done with match between runs (match window of 0.7 min and alignment window of 20 min). Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification whereas oxidation of methionines, protein N-term acetylation and phosphorylation of serines, threonines and tyrosines as variable modifications. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids and a maximum of two tryptic missed-cleavages were allowed. Results were filtered at 0.01 FDR (peptide and protein level). Protein intensity values (obtained from the proteingroups.txt file) were then used to calculate the normalization factor needed in each case.
Mouse models
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutio de Salud Carlos Tercero Ethics Committee (PROEX/027/15) and performed in accordance with the guidelines stated in the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals developed by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. Four- to 6-week-old female athymic nude mice (Hsd: Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. For the metastasis model, 5 × 106 luciferase-expressing cancer cell lines were suspended in 200 μl of 1× PBS and injected intraperitoneally into female nude mice. Bioluminescence signal was followed once per week by IVIS Spectrum imaging system (PerkinElmer). For mammary fat pad injections 1 × 106 cells were re-suspended in 50% Matrigel (Corning) and injected (50 μl volume). Regarding patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) Surgical or biopsy specimens from primary tumors or metastatic lesions were immediately implanted in mice. Fragments of 30 to 60 mm3 were implanted into the mammary fat pad (surgery samples) or the lower flank (metastatic samples) of 6-week-old female athymic HsdCpb:NMRI-Foxn1nu mice (Harlan Laboratories). Upon growth of the engrafted tumors, the model was perpetuated by serial transplantation onto the lower flank.
Tumor formation and growth were monitored weekly by using calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula V = (D °−d2)/2 mm3, where D is the largest diameter and d is the shortest diameter. Mice were euthanized when reaching humane end point (1500 mm3). Tumors were excised and fixed (10% formalin solution) for histological examination (FFPE) or snap-frozen for subsequent analysis.
Animal treatments
Animals were randomized (http://www.randomization.com/) to receive vehicle, single agents or combinations when the tumors reached 500 mm3 size (intramammary tumors) or two days after the intraperitoneal injections. Sample size was chosen based on previous data for similar assays. For the animal treatments palbociclib, dissolved in 50 mM sodium lactate buffer, pH 4.0, was administered by oral gavage at 100 mg/kg/day. GDC-0994 was dissolved in 2% DMSO + 30% PEG-300 + 5% Tween80 + dH2O and administered by oral gavage at the dose of 50 mg/kg/day. Imatinib was dissolved in sterile saline and administered by intraperitoneal injection at the dose of 70 mg/kg/day. Investigators were blinded to treatment assignment during the experiment. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated using the following formula: TGI = [1−(TF/T0)A/(TF/T0)V] × 100, where TF is the time point analyzed, T0 is the initial time, A () is the tumor measurement corresponding to drug treatment, and V() is the tumor measurement from the vehicle treatment. The same formula used for the in vivo experiments for antagonism, indifferent or additive activity threshold was used for TGI. The effects of the combinations were calculated at the last time point when the animals belonging to the treatment group that was first terminated because of tumor growth.
Generation of PNKP knockout cells
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 All-in One Lentivector system was purchased from Applied Biological Materials (ABM). Recombinant lentiviruses were generated in HEK 293T cells by cotransfection of sgRNA-encoding plasmids targeting human PNKP (Cat#K1676005) with pVSV-G and psPAX2 packaging plasmids (Addgene). MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were infected with the sgRNA-encoding lentivirus and stable cells were established by puromycin selection (1.5 μg/ml) (Sigma). After 7 days of lentiviral infection, protein levels of PNKP were measured by western blot.
Immunohistochemistry
Samples were included in fresh 10% neutral buffered formalin immediately after surgical excision. The lag times from excision to fixing and intra-hospital tissue mobilization procedures were minimized following the protocols proposed for tissue biobanking. Cold ischemia times varied from 30 s to a maximum of 20 min. Formalin-fixation times ranged from 16 to 24 h (from surgical excision until the next morning). Tissue microarrays were mounted with two 1-mm cores per sample (MTA-I, Beecher Instruments) with the validation set samples. An expert pathologist examined a template H&E slide from each sample to select the areas for core selection.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 5-μm TMA sections. Deparafinization and antigen retrieval (cell conditioning) were performed on DISCOVERY XT automated slide staining system using validated reagents (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.).
The following antibodies were used for IHC: phospho-AKT (Ser473) (D9E, #4060) (1:10), phospho-p70S6K (Thr389) (1A5, #9206) (1:150), phospho-p44/42 (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) (#9101) (1:100), phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein (Ser240/Ser244) (D68F8, #5364) (1:250), phosho-PNKP (Ser114/Thr118) (#3522S) (1:50), phospho-p90RSK (Ser380) (D3H11, #11989S) (1:30) and phospho-Rb (Ser807/811) (D20B12, #8516) (1:100) (all from Cell Signaling Technology); CDK6 (98D/H8, Monoclonal Antibodies Core Unit, CNIO) (1:1); PKC Epsilon (EPR1482(2), #LS-B7689/36454) (1:200), DAPK3/ZIPK (#LS-B557/43125) (1:10) and phospho-CHK1 (Ser45) (#LS-C177888) (1:50) from LifeSpan BioScience; PIM1 (12H8 #sc-13513, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) (1:10), c-KIT/CD117 (#A4502 Dako) (1:200) and CLK-1 (#SAB1300108 Sigma-Aldrich) (1:100).
Corresponding TMA were acquired and digitalized using the Ariol SL-50 system coupled with fully automated microscope system Leica DM6000 B. Scores were generated using the TMASight assay, providing areas of high staining (Area_Color 1), medium staining (Area_Color 2) and low staining (Area_Color 3). We calculated the percentage of each staining per biopsy normalized to Area_Color 4, which represents the whole tissue, providing a computerized H-score calculated by formula: ((% of Area_Color1×3) + (% of Area_Color2×2) + (% of Area_Color 1×1))/100
Immunoblots
Cells were washed 2× with PBS and harvested in cold RIPA Buffer (Sigma) containing 1% protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Halt EDTA-free; Thermo Scientific). Cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, sonicated for 15 min and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Protein concentration was estimated by a colorimetric assay (660 nm protein assay; Pierce) following the manufacture’s instruction. In total 20 μg of proteins per sample were loaded on 10% SDS–PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for further processing. 5% BSA was used to block the membrane for 60 min at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary antibodies.
The following primary antibodies were used: phospho-AKT (Ser473) (D9E, #4060) (1:1000), phospho-p70S6K (Thr389) (#9205) (1:1000), p70S6K (#9292) (1:1000), phospho-p44/42 (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) (#9101S) (1:1000), p44/42 (ERK1/2) (#9102) (1:1000), phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein (Ser240/Ser244) (D68F8, #5364) (1:1000) and phosho-PNKP (Ser114/Thr118) (#3522S) (1:1000) (all from Cell Signaling Technology); CDK6 ready to use (clone 98D/H8, Monoclonal Antibodies Core Unit, CNIO), PKC Epsilon (EPR1482(2), #LS-B7689/36454) (1:1000), DAPK3/ZIPK (#LS-B557/43125) (1:1000) and phospho-CHK1 (Ser45) (#LS-C177888) (1:1000) from LifeSpan BioScience, c-KIT/CD117 (clone YR145, #04-214, Milipore) (1:1000), PNKP (#NBP1-87257, Novus biologicals) (1:1000), CLK-1 (#SAB1300108) (1:1000), Vinculin (#V9131) (1:5000) and β-Actin (clone AC-15, #A1978) (1:5000) from Sigma-Aldrich. Membranes were incubated with appropriate peroxidase-conjugate secondary antibodies (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Lumi-LightPlus detection kit; Roche). Uncropped versions of the blots can be found in Supplementary Figures 14–16.
Proteomics sample preparation and runs
All tumor samples in study had >75% tumor content. We interrogated the phosphoproteome by enriching the phospho-fraction out of 250 micrograms of purified protein per sample by Ti4-IMAC chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry. Given the large number of samples and the limited amount of material of the clinical specimens, we aimed to probe the phosphoproteome using a label-free single-shot strategy as described previously by de Graaf et al.. Such approach allows highly reproducible measurements, both qualitatively and quantitatively, over a large dynamic range.
Frozen tumor samples were homogenized using a Precellys 24 device (Bertin Technologies) in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 7 M urea (ThermoFisher Scientific), 2 M thiourea, 2% N-octyl glucoside (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 15 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Halt EDTA-free; Thermo Scientific), and 0.1% Benzonase Nuclease (Novagen).
Tumor cell lines were washed 2 times with cold PBS 1× and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% N-octyl glucoside (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 15 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Halt EDTA-free; Thermo Scientific), and 0.1% Benzonase Nuclease (Novagen).
Protein lysates from tumors and cells were sonicated for 15 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 14,100 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Protein concentration was estimated by a colorimetric assay (660 nm protein assay; Pierce; Rockford, IL, USA) using bovine serum albumin as reference.
Protein samples were digested using the filter-aided sample preparation method Briefly, 250 μg of each tumor and cell line protein extract dissolved in lysis buffer was reduced with 10 mM DTT for 20 min at 56 °C and alkylated using 50 mM IAA solution for 20 min at 25 °C in the dark. The excess of reduction and alkylation reagents were washed with 8 M urea in 100 mM Tris (pH 8). The proteins were digested at 37 °C in wet chamber for 4 h using endoproteinase Lys-C at a 1:50 enzyme-to-protein ratio. After Lys-C digestion, urea was adjusted to 2 M with 50 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate. Trypsin (Promega) was added at a 1:50 (enzyme-to-protein ratio) and samples were subjected to a second digestion at 37 °C overnight in wet chamber. The digestion was quenched by acidification with formic acid (0.1% final concentration). Prior to phosphopeptide enrichment, digested samples were cleaned up with reversed phase-based solid-phase extraction (SPE). Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using Ti4+-IMAC GELoader spin tips by centrifugation. Briefly, Geloader tip microcolumns packed with Ti4 ± IMAC beads were created using a C8 plug at the constricted end. An aliquot of the Ti4 ± IMAC beads suspension was packed in the tip at the ratio 2:1 of beads:peptides. Max 250 µg of each digested tumor or cell line sample was loaded onto the column and centrifuged at 50 g for 30 min to allow the binding of phosphopeptides to the Ti4 + -IMAC beads (~3 µl/min). Bound phosphopeptides were washed with 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in 6% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) by centrifugation at 170 g (~3 µl/min). Afterwards two additional washing step were performed, first one with 50% ACN/ 0.5%TFA in 200 mM NaCl and second one with 50% ACN/0.1% TFA. Both washing steps were performed by centrifugation at 170 g (~3 µl / min). Phosphopeptides were eluted from the column with 10% ammonia into 25% formic acid (FA) and centrifuged at 100 g (~1 µl/min). Finally, a second elution was carried out with 80% ACN/2%FA and centrifuged at 100 g (~1 µl/min). Phosphopeptides were acidified by adding 3 µl of 100% FA. The eluated was directly injected and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
Peptides were subjected to reverse phase nano-LC-MS/MS analysis using a Proxeon EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific) with an analytical column heater (40 °C) and an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were first trapped (Reprosil C18, Dr Maisch, GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany, 3 μm, 2 cm × 100 μm) at a maximum pressure of 800 bar with 100% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) before being separated on a 40 cm × 50 µm analytical column (Poroshell 120 EC-C18, 2.7 µm, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Peptides were chromatographically separated by a 90-min gradient from 7 to 30% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in ACN) at a flow rate of 100 nL/min. The total measurement time for each sample was 120 min. The eluent was sprayed via a distal coated fused silica emitter (360-μm outer diameter, 20-μm inner diameter, 10-μm tip inner diameter; constructed in-house) butt-connected to the analytical column. The electrospray voltage was set at 1.7 kV. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS. Briefly, survey full-scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer, scanning from m/z 350 to m/z 1500 at a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400 using an automatic gain control setting of 1e6 ions. Charge state screening was enabled, and precursors with either unknown or 1 + charge states were excluded. After the survey scan, the 20 most intense precursors were selected for subsequent decision-tree-based ion trap CID or ETD fragmentation. The normalized collision energy for CID was set at 35%, and supplemental activation for ETD and dynamic exclusion were enabled (exclusion size list: 500; exclusion duration: 40 s).
Proteomics data analysis and kinase prediction
The raw MS data were processed with MaxQuant software suite version 1.3.0.5. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD008012The fragmentation spectra were searched against the Homo sapiens Uniprot database (downloaded on 23-12-2013), using Andromeda as the search engine. The precursor mass tolerances were set to 20 ppm for the first search and 4.5 for the main search. Also, 0.05 and 0.5 Da were used for FT and IT detectors. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was considered as fixed modifications, whereas oxidation of methionine (M); phosphorylation on serine (S), threonine (T) and tyrosine (Y); and protein N-terminal acetylation were chosen as a variable modification, and up to two tryptic missed cleavages were allowed. The match between run function was enabled. A target-decoy database searching strategy was used to evaluate the false-discovery rates (FDRs) at the peptide and protein level.
The identification of kinase specific substrates was evaluated using linear sequence motifs analysis implemented in MaxQuant. For the identification of phosphorylated motifs Maxquant used the PhosphoMotif Finder search tool at Human Protein Reference Database was used (http://www.hprd.org/PhosphoMotif_finder).
We applied the Consensus Clustering module using ConsensusClusterPlus package available in Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/) for class discovery and clustering validation. This method facilitates the discovery of biologically meaningful clusters assessing the stability for the discovered clusters by means of resampling techniques. Briefly, a clustering method chosen by the user is applied to each of the resampled data sets and, the consensus among the multiple runs, is assessed and summarized in a consensus matrix. This matrix is used as a visualization tool to estimate the cluster composition and number. For this study the Consensus Clustering analyses were run with hierarchical clustering algorithm, and Pearson correlation using 1000 resampling iterations.
Differentially expressed phosphopeptides were obtained by applying linear models with R limma package (Bioconductor project, http://www.bioconductor.org). To account for multiple hypotheses testing, the estimated significance level (p value) was adjusted using Benjamini & Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. Those phospho-sites with FDR < 0.15 were selected as differentially phosphorylated between classes under comparison. Representative Heat-Map was depictured using GENE-E software. (www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/)
A gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to define set of kinase substrate motifs that shows statistically significant, concordant differences between relapsed and cured cases and aggressive and indolent triple-negative cell lines, herein termed Kinase-set enrichment analysis (KSEA). To this end, KSEA was applied using annotations for motifs extracted from Perseus software. Leading proteins were ranked based on their intensities. After Kolmogorov-Smirnoff testing, those kinase sets showing FDR < 0.05 were selected as significant.
GO pathways
Gene-ontology pathway analysis was performed with Enrichr: a comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/#).
Next generation sequencing
Massive parallel sequencing was performed using a custom panel of 100 genes (Entire Transcribed Region) with a size of 844Kbp. DNA was extracted from 113 FFPE samples using High Pure FFPET DNA isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics). Quality of DNA samples was measured by OD 260/280 ratio ranging from 1.8 to 2.0, and also by 2100 Bioanalyzer and DNA 1000 Assay (Agilent Technologies).
Processing of samples for sequencing was done using Sure Select XT Target Enrichment System for Illumina Paired-end Multiplexed Sequencing Library (Agilent Technologies). Genomic DNA was sheared to a fragment size between 120 and 150 bp using Covaris E-series. In total 400 ng of shared DNA were repaired the ends, adenylated the 3′ end of the DNA fragments and ligated the pared–end adapter according to manufacturer’s protocol. DNA were purified using AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics).
The captured libraries were amplified with indexing primers containing 8 bp indexes (Supplementary Data 4) and quality and quantity analysis were done using 2100 Bioanalyzer and DNA 1000 Assay (Agilent Technologies), selecting the DNA with a fragment size peak of ~225–275 bp and the concentration was determined by integration under the peak.
gDNA libraries were hybridized with a target-specific Capture Library in 75 samples out of 113 due to quality and quantity of DNA after DNA extraction and sequential purification steps. The targeted molecules were captured with streptavidin beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1, Life Technologies). Quality analysis of indexed libraries were done using the 2100 Bioanalyzer and High Sensitivity DNA Assay (Agilent Technologies) selecting the DNA with a fragment size peak of approximately 250 to 350 bp, concentration was measure by Qubit Assay (Qubit BR dsDNA Assay Kit, Life technologies). Libraries were combined into pools of 10 nM. Samples were sequenced by a HiSeq 2500 powerful high-throughput sequencing system. We used a flowcell rapid run in a format 100 bp paired-end reads (2 × 100PE). 69 samples were correctly sequenced with an average of coverage of 278×.
Fastq Data generated by the sequencing was aligned to the hg19 human reference sequence. Data were analyzed using RUbioSeq, additionally MuTect was executed in order to identify variants with low frequency undetectable with RUbioSeq pipeline. Variants with sufficient coverage and good quality metrics were annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) with Ensembl v83. We also added information about pathogenicity from ClinVar database and COSMIC frequencies and pathogenic prediction for each variant. Using the annotations and visual inspection we removed possible artefacts that survived the variant calling filters. Polymorphisms were also discarded using the population frequencies of the 1000 Genomes Project and ExAC provided by VEP. From the remaining set of variants we selected the most relevant using the pathogenic impact and the clinical evidences (Variants described in ClinVar and COSMIC with pathogenic prediction and also variants with a relevant high impact in SIFT, PolyPhen or Condel).
Statistics
In order to study the impact of the enriched kinases, their H-scores (continuous variables) were categorized to allow Kaplan-Meier analysis. The kinase scores were categorized as follows: patients with a kinase staining above the 75th percentile were encoded as “1”, whereas the remainder were encoded as “0” (both for the Kaplan–Meier tests and the Cox models). The kinases with positive association with relapse were grouped into a single variant (K-high); patients with a staining in one or more (positively associated) kinases above the 75th percentile were encoded as K-high = 1; in order to be encoded as K-high = 0, patients had to have a staining below the 75th percentile in all six kinases. Both the prognostic value of each candidate kinase and that of K-high was calculated in two ways: with the Kaplan Meier method and the Log-Rank test (univariate), and with the Cox’s proportionate hazards model (multivariate model, adjusting the hazard ratio attributable to each kinase by the T and N status, age and grade), implementing a multiple comparisons correction (Bonferroni) to the cut-off point of P < 0.05. In addition, prognosis accuracy of K-high was compared with other variables (K-test) resulting from the combination of 2, 3, 4 or 5 kinases with staining above the 75th percentile. Nine different variables (K-test1 to K-test9) were generated and Kaplan–Meier curves, Log-Rank tests and multivariate Cox’x analysis were run for each test variable corrected by multiple comparisons effect (Bonferroni). Kinase co-linearity was investigated with the Pearson´s coefficient in a pairwise manner.
Tumor burden comparisons and survival benefit between treatment groups for the in vivo experiments were performed with a t-test (average burden obtained from at least 10 tumors per time point and condition) and the Kaplan–Meier method (used to compare the time-to-sacrifice between treatment groups). The minimum number of animals per group was calculated in order to detect a minimum of 30% variation in the time to sacrifice (institutional guidelines set mandatory sacrifice when tumors grow >1000 mm3), based on the medium time to sacrifice and standard deviation of the vehicle-treated animals and setting alpha and beta errors in 5% and 20%, respectively. All tests were performed with the SPSS Statistics V.19.0 software.
