ABSTRACT:
SUMOylation is a reversible post-translational modification essential for genome stability. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we have studied global SUMOylation in human cells and in a site-specific manner, identifying a total of over 4,300 SUMOylation sites in over 1,600 proteins. Moreover, for the first time in excess of 1,000 SUMOylation sites were identified under standard growth conditions. SUMOylation dynamics were quantitatively studied in response to SUMO protease inhibition, proteasome inhibition and heat shock. A considerable amount of SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitylated, acetylated or methylated, indicating crosstalk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. We identified 70 phosphorylation and 4 acetylation events in close proximity to SUMOylation sites, and provide evidence for acetylation-dependent SUMOylation of endogenous histone H3. SUMOylation regulates target proteins involved in all nuclear processes including transcription, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, pre-mRNA splicing and ribosome assembly.

The corresponding nucleotide sequences were cloned in between the PstI and XhoI sites of the plasmid pLV-CMV-IRES-GFP .
Cell culture & cell line generation
HeLa and U2-OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U per mL penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). HeLa cells stably expressing His10-SUMO-2 or His10-SUMO-2-K0-Q87R were generated through lentiviral infection with a virus encoding His10-SUMO-2-IRES-GFP or His10-SUMO-2-K0-Q87R-IRES-GFP. Two weeks after infection, cells were fluorescence-sorted for a low expression level of GFP using a FACSAria II (BD Biosciences). Cells were passed through a 100 μm capillary at a pressure of 138 kPa, and selected for 7.5*102-3*103 GFP BF 530-30-A intensity, which was 2.5-10 times higher than the background cellular auto-fluorescence of 3*102.
Treatments, transfection & lentiviral infection
In order to accumulate SUMOylated proteins, cells were treated with 10 μM MG-132 (Sigma) dissolved in DMSO for 7 hours, treated with 20 μM PR-619 (Millipore) dissolved in DMSO for 7 hours, or incubated at 43°C for 1 hour (heat shock). For increasing acetylation of histones, Trichostatin A (TSA, Sigma) was used at a concentration of 150 nM or 600 nM for 18 hours . In order to decrease acetylation of histones, curcumin (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 25 μM and 50 μM for 18 hours . For transfection, cells were cultured in DMEM lacking penicillin and streptomycin. Transfections were performed using 2.5 μg of polyethylenimine (PEI) per 1 μg of plasmid DNA, using 1 μg of DNA per 1 million cells. Transfection reagents were mixed in 150 mM NaCl and incubated for 15 minutes before adding it directly to the cells. Cells were split after 24 hours and investigated after 48 hours. Lentiviruses were generated essentially as described previously . Infections were performed with a multiplicity of infection of 2 and using a concentration of 8 μg per mL polybrene in the medium. 24 hours after infection the medium was replaced.
Purification of His10-SUMO-2 and His10-SUMO-2-K0-Q87R – Stage 1
Per single MS/MS run to identify SUMO-2 sites, one single fully confluent 15-cm dish of His10-SUMO-2-K0-Q87R (~20 million cells) was prepared. Cells were washed three times on the plate with ice-cold PBS, prior to scraping cells and collecting them in a 15 mL tube. Cells were centrifuged at 250 RCF and re-suspended in ice-cold PBS. Subsequently, the cell pellets were lysed in 10 pellet volumes of guanidine Lysis Buffer (6 M guanidine-HCl, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 8.0). Lysates were subjected to sonication using a microtip sonicator at a power of 30 Watts. Sonication bursts of 5 seconds per 5 mL lysate were used, up to a total sonication time of 15 seconds. Subsequently, lysates were supplemented by addition of imidazole to 50 mM and β-mercaptoethanol to 5 mM. 20 μL (dry volume) Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) were prepared per 1 mL lysate, by washing them four times with guanidine Lysis Buffer supplemented with imidazole to 50 mM and β-mercaptoethanol to 5 mM. The equilibrated beads were added to the lysates and allowed to tumble overnight at 4°C. Following overnight incubation, beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 RCF, and washed for at least 15 minutes using at least 5 bead volumes of the following Wash Buffers in order. Wash Buffer 1: 6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 8.0. Wash Buffer 2: 8 M urea, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 8.0. Wash Buffer 3: 8 M urea, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 6.3. Wash Buffer 4: 8 M urea, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 6.3. Wash Buffer 5 (same as Wash Buffer 4): 8 M urea, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 6.3. Subsequently, all Wash Buffer was removed from the beads, and proteins were eluted for 30 minutes using one bead volume of Elution Buffer (7 M urea, 500 mM imidazole, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 7.0). The elution procedure was repeated another two times, and all elutions were pooled and passed through 0.45 μM filters (Ultrafree, Millipore). For mass spectrometric analysis, samples were concentrated over 100 kDa cut-off filters (Vivacon 500, Sartorius Stedim), at 20°C and at 8,000 RCF. Concentration was performed until <10-50 μL of sample remained. After concentration, the proteins remaining on the filters were washed once using 250 μL of Elution Buffer minus imidazole, and re-concentrated. Final concentrated SUMOylated proteins were removed from the filters and were snap frozen and stored at −80°C. The single-stage purified SUMOylated proteins are compatible with both in-gel and in-solution digestion protocols and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis, or may be target-specifically investigated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis. Alternatively, re-purification of SUMOylated peptides is performed by following Stage 2 of the protocol.
Purification of His10-SUMO-2-K0-Q87R – Stage 2
Sequencing Grade Endoproteinase Lys-C (Promega) was added to the samples in a 1:25 enzyme-to-protein ratio, and incubated for 4 hours at room temperature, still, and in the dark. Subsequently, another 10 mM of fresh β-mercaptoethanol was added to the samples, followed by an additional amount of Lys-C equal to the first amount. The second incubation was performed overnight, at room temperature, still and in the dark. Next, digests were transferred to 15 mL tubes and diluted with an amount of guanidine Lysis Buffer equal to half the amount used to lyse the initial cell pellet. The samples were then supplemented with addition of imidazole to 50 mM, and β-mercaptoethanol to 5 mM. Next, 40 μL (dry volume) Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) were prepared per 1 mL sample. The equilibrated beads were added to the lysates and allowed to tumble at 4°C for 5 hours. Following incubation, beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 RCF, and washed for 15 minutes using at least 5 bead volumes of the following Wash Buffers in order. Wash Buffer 1: 6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 8.0. Wash Buffer 2: 8 M urea, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 8.0. Wash Buffer 3: 8 M urea, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 6.3. Wash Buffer 4: 8 M urea, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 6.3. Wash Buffer 5 (same as Wash Buffer 4): 8 M urea, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 6.3. Subsequently, all Wash Buffer was removed from the beads, and proteins were eluted for 20 minutes using one bead volume of Elution Buffer (7 M urea, 500 mM imidazole, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM TRIS, buffered at pH 7.0). The elution procedure was repeated twice, and all elutions were pooled and passed through 0.45 μM filters (Ultrafree, Millipore). Next, samples were concentrated on 10 kDa cut-off spin filters (Vivacon 500, Sartorius Stedim), at 20°C and at 14,000 RCF. Concentration was performed until <10-25 μL of sample remained. After concentration, the proteins remaining on the filters were washed twice using 250 μL of Elution Buffer minus imidazole, and re-concentrated. Final concentrated SUMOylated peptides were removed from the filters and were snap frozen and stored at −80°C. The double-purified SUMOylated peptides are compatible with in-solution digestion protocols and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis aimed at determination of specific sites of protein SUMOylation.
In-solution digestion
SUMOylated peptides were supplemented with ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) to 50 mM. Subsequently, dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to a concentration of 1 mM, and samples were left to incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. Next, chloroacetamide was added to a concentration of 5 mM, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After alkylation, another 5 mM of DTT was added, and samples were left to incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this point, samples were gently diluted 4-fold using 50 mM ABC. Subsequently, an amount of Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin (Promega) was added equal to 25% of the Lys-C initially used in a single digestion step. Digestion with trypsin was performed overnight, at room temperature, still and in the dark.
LC-MS/MS analysis
In-solution digested peptides were cleaned, desalted and concentrated on triple-disc C18 reverse phase StageTips , before being eluted twice with 25 μL 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Desalted peptides were vacuum centrifuged at room temperature until 10% of the original volume remained, prior to online nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The analysis of in-solution digested peptides was performed using an EASY-nLC system (Proxeon) connected to a Q-Exactive (Thermo) using Higher-Collisional Dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. Separation of peptides was performed using 20 cm long analytical columns (ID 75 μm, Polymicro Avantes) packed in-house with 1.8 μm C18 beads (Reprospher 100), using a 120 minute gradient from 5% to 75% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid and a flow rate of 250 nL per minute. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode using a top 10 method. Full-scan MS spectra were acquired with a target value of 3E6 and a resolution of 70,000, with a scan range from 300 to 1,750 m/z. HCD tandem MS/MS spectra were acquired using a target value of 1E5, a resolution of 17,500, and a normalized collision energy of 25%. All charges lower than 2 and higher than 6 were rejected, and all unknown charges were rejected. The underfill ratio was set to 0.1%, and a dynamic exclusion of 20 seconds was used. Alternatively, the underfill ratio was set to 1.0% with the dynamic exclusion time set to 10 seconds.
Data processing
MaxQuant version 1.4.1.2 was used to analyze all RAW data . The control condition experiment was performed in biological hexuplicate, and measured as 11 technical replicates. The heat shock experiment was performed in biological triplicate, and measured as 6 technical replicates. The MG-132 experiment was performed in biological triplicate, and measured as 6 technical replicates. The PR-619 experiment was performed in biological quintuplicate, and measured as 9 technical replicates. MS/MS spectra were filtered and deisotoped and the 15 most abundant fragments for each 100 m/z were retained. MS/MS spectra were filtered for a mass tolerance of 6 ppm for precursor masses, and a mass tolerance of 20 ppm was used for fragment ions. Peptide and protein identification was performed through matching the identified MS/MS spectra versus a target-decoy version of the complete human Uniprot database, in addition to a database of commonly observed mass spectrometry contaminants. Up to 3 missed tryptic cleavages were allowed. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed peptide modification. Protein N-terminal acetylation, peptide N-terminal carbamylation, methionine oxidation, QQTGG and pyro-QQTGG were set as variable peptide modifications. QQTGG was set as a lysine-specific modification, with a monoisotopic mass of 471.20776, and not allowed to occur at the C-terminal end of peptides. Pyro-QQTGG may spontaneously form out of the tryptic QQTGG remnant as a result of cyclization of the N-terminal glutamine. Pyro-QQTGG (pQQTGG) was set as s lysine-specific modification, with a monoisotopic mass of 454.18121, and not allowed to occur at the C-terminal end of peptides. In order to increase identification confidence, diagnostic peaks were searched within MS/MS spectra corresponding to SUMOylated peptides. To this end, candidate MS/MS spectra were searched for peaks corresponding in m/z to fragmentation of the tryptic QQTGG or pQQTGG remnant present on all SUMOylated peptides. For QQTGG; b5-QQTGG, b4-QQTG, b3-QQT and b2-QQ were accepted as diagnostic peaks. For pQQTGG; b5-pQQTGG, b4-pQQTG, b3-pQQT and b2-pQQ were accepted as diagnostic peaks. In addition to the above variable modifications, lysine acetylation and serine-threonine-tyrosine phosphorylation were individually added as further variable modifications in separate searches. For protein identification, peptides with all above variable modifications were accepted, and protein identification by at least one single SUMO-modified unique peptide was performed. Peptides were accepted with a minimum length of 6 amino acids, a maximum size of 5 kDa, and a maximum charge of 6. The processed data was filtered by posterior error probability (PEP) to achieve a protein false discovery rate (FDR) of below 1%, a peptide-spectrum match FDR of below 1%, and in addition a site decoy fraction of 1% was set. SUMO-site peptides were additionally filtered to have an Andromeda score of at least 40, a localization score of at least 40, a localization probability of at least 90%, and the presence of at least one diagnostic QQTGG or pyro-QQTGG fragment in the MS/MS spectrum.
The mass spectrometry proteomics RAW data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium , via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD001061.
Label-Free Quantification (LFQ)
Label-Free Quantification was performed using MaxQuant LFQ. Quantification was performed over 17 biological replicates, including 6 control, 3 heat shock, 3 MG-132 and 5 PR-619 replicates. The standard (not fast) LFQ algorithm was used with otherwise default settings (min. ratio count of 2, min. neighbors of 3, average neighbors of 6). Protein LFQ values were Log2 transformed for further processing. Proteins were filtered for the presence of at least two identifying peptides, and at least one SUMOylated peptide. To ensure biological reproducibility, only proteins detected in at least three biological replicates in any of the four treatment conditions were retained. Subsequently, missing values were imputed using Perseus software, with a down shift of 1.8 (Log2) and a variance of 0.3 (Log2) below the lowest detectable value within each separate replicate. LFQ values were median-averaged within all treatment conditions, and subsequently control condition LFQ values were subtracted from heat shock, MG-132 and PR-619 values to yield the final Log2 ratio.

Electrophoresis and immunoblotting
Protein samples were size-fractionated on Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gels using MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen). Size-separated proteins were transferred to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a submarine system (Invitrogen). Gels were Coomassie stained according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Membranes were stained for total protein loading using 0.1% Ponceau-S in 5% acetic acid (Sigma). Membranes were blocked using PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and 5% milk powder for one hour. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated, in blocking solution. Incubation with primary antibody was performed overnight at 4°C. Afterwards, membranes were washed three times with PBST and briefly blocked again with blocking solution. Next, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (donkey-anti-mouse-HRP or rabbit-anti-goat-HRP, 1:2,500) for one hour, before washing three times with PBST and two times with PBS. Membranes were then treated with ECL2 (Pierce) as per manufacturer’s instructions, and chemiluminescence was captured using Biomax XAR film (Kodak).
