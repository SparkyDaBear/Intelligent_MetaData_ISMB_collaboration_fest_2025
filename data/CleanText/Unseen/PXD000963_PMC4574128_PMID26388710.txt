ABSTRACT:
Background
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and the third leading cause of cancer related deaths among men living in developed countries. Biomarkers that predict disease outcome at the time of initial diagnosis would substantially aid disease management.
Results
Proteins extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were identified using nanoflow liquid chromatography-MALDI MS/MS or after separation by one- or two-dimensional electrophoresis. The proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000963. A list of potential biomarker candidates, based on proposed associations with prostate cancer, was derived from the 320 identified proteins. Candidate biomarkers were then examined by multiplexed Western blotting of archival specimens from men with premetastatic disease and subsequent disease outcome data. Annexin A2 provided the best prediction of risk of metastatic disease (log-rank Chi squared p = 0. 025). A tumor/control tissue >2-fold relative abundance increase predicted early biochemical failure, while <2-fold change predicted late or no biochemical failure.
Conclusions
This study confirms the potential for use of archival FFPE specimens in the search for prognostic biomarkers for prostate cancer and suggests that annexin A2 abundance in diagnostic biopsies is predictive for metastatic potential. Protein profiling each cancer may lead to an overall reduction in mortality from metastatic prostate cancer as well as reduced treatment associated morbidity.

Methods
Study design and sample processing
FFPE tissue blocks containing prostate biopsies from Wellington men who entered the TROG 96.01 clinical trial were used in the current study. Proteomic studies on the biopsies were approved by the Wellington Ethics Committee. The biopsies were collected from 1996 to 2000 at the time of initial diagnosis before treatment and were immediately processed to FFPE blocks. The study design for TROG 96.01 has been described. Eight hundred and eighteen men (ages 41–87), from Australia and New Zealand, who had locally advanced PCa without distant metastases, received either radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation for 3 or 6 months. Benefits of androgen deprivation included better control of serum PSA (biochemical control) and PCa specific survival. For the current proteomic study, tissue was included from 16 men who were treated with radiation plus androgen deprivation. For each man, the presenting tumor characteristics are provided in Additional file 8. The clinical endpoints were whether or not biochemical failure occurred, and if it did, the time from randomization to the event.
Initially, sections (20 µm thick, approximately 25 mm2) cut from a FFPE radical prostatectomy tissue block were used for investigation and optimization of protein extraction, 1DE, 2DE, MS and Western blotting. Protein recovery after incubation of 20 µm thick sections (approximately 25 mm2) in Extraction Buffer (see below) was 142 ± 58 µg protein/mg dry tissue (n = 2). Subsequently, Western blot analysis was carried out on proteins extracted from tumor and control regions of FFPE needle biopsies for statistical analysis of protein association with disease outcome. Tissue harvesting for proteomics was carried out by pathologists (BD and PF). FFPE sections (5 µm) from each block were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and examined to localize the site of the tumor. Tumor and control regions were excised from adjacent unstained sections under a dissecting microscope. FFPE sections (10 µm) were deparaffinised at room temperature using 1 mL xylene (3× 2 min), followed by rehydration in ethanol series (100 %, 90 %, 80 %, 70 %, 5 min each) and air dried.
Deparaffinised, air-dried tissue samples were incubated in 250 µL of Extraction Buffer consisting of 40 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.2), 2 % SDS, and 3 % DTT (dithiothreitol) for 1 h at room temperature followed by 20 min at 100 °C. Samples were immediately centrifuged at 14,000×g for 15 min and each supernatant was added to 1.25 mL of Precipitation Solution (ProteoExtract® Protein Precipitation Kit, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and incubated overnight at −20 °C before centrifugation at 14,000×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein pellets were washed 2× 5 min using 500 µL ProteoExtract® Wash Solution, air-dried for 5 min and resuspended in either rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2 % CHAPS, 20 mM DTT, 0.5 % immobilized pH gradient buffer, trace bromophenol blue) for 2DE; 1× LDS sample buffer containing Sample Reducing Agent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for Gel-MS/MS; or 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5), 8 M urea, 0.1 % SDS for LC–MS/MS. The protein concentration of each sample was assayed using a 2-D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). 1DE, 2DE, sample processing for mass spectrometry including digestion with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany), identification of proteins from 2DE gels by MALDI mass fingerprinting, and immunoblotting were carried out as previously described.
Gel-MS/MS
Protein extracts (30 µg) from FFPE tissue blocks were separated in triplicate by 1DE on 8 × 8 cm 4–12 % NuPAGE gels and fixed for 90 min at room temperature in 50 % ethanol:3 % orthophosphoric acid, then washed 3× with water. Each sample lane was sliced horizontally into 30–35 slices that were then transferred to the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate and processed in a GE Healthcare Ettan digester. Each gel piece was diced into approximately 1 mm3 cubes, destained using 50 % methanol:50 mM NH4HCO3 (3× 45 min), and air-dried for 2 h. Proteins were digested for 6 h using 10 µL trypsin solution (2.5 ng/µL trypsin in 20 mM NH4HCO3) per well. Digest peptides were extracted using ACN (acetonitrile):0.1 % TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) 1:1 (3× 45 min), air-dried, then resuspended in 2 µL 10 mg mL−1 CHCA (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) in ACN:0.1 % TFA 1:1 and spotted onto an ABSCIEX 5800 MALDI TOF/TOF target plate.
LC–MS/MS
Total protein extracts (50 µg) were reconstituted overnight at 4 °C in 50 µL of 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8. 5), 8 M urea, 0.1 % SDS. Proteins were reduced in 5 mM DTT for 1 h, alkylated for 30 min in 10 mM iodoacetamide, and quenched in 15 mM DTT, all at room temperature. Samples were diluted 10-fold by the addition of 450 µL of 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.5) and digested overnight at room temperature using 2.5 µg of trypsin per sample. Digests were lyophilised, resuspended in 500 µL 0.1 % TFA and purified using Omix C18 reverse-phase 100 µL tips (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Peptides were eluted into 100 µL of ACN:0.1 % TFA 7:3, lyophilised, and resuspended in 30 µL 0.1 % TFA. Reverse-phase LC-MALDI was performed in triplicate using a TEMPO LC-MALDI spotter system (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA) with a 150 × 0.1 mm Chromolith® CapRod® RP-18e monolithic column (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA). Five microlitres of each sample was injected into a 3 µL sample loop at 1 µL min−1. Peptide separation was achieved using a mobile phase system comprised of 2 % ACN, 0.1 % TFA (Reagent A) and 98 % ACN-0.1 %TFA (Reagent B) with a 36 min linear gradient of 0–80 % Reagent B at 1 µL min−1. Eluted peptides were mixed on-line with MALDI matrix (CHCA in ACN-0.1 % TFA 1:1 at 1 µL min−1) and spotted at 16 s intervals onto an ABSCIEX 5800 target plate.
Mass spectrometry and database searches
Gel-MS/MS and LC–MS/MS spectra were collected using an ABSCIEX 5800 MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer in positive ion mode. TOF/TOF data files were searched against UniProtKB human sequences (88,473 sequences, final searches 17 January 2014) using ProteinPilot v3.0 (AB SCIEX) with the Paragon algorithm. Search parameters were maximum one missed trypsin cleavage, maximum 50 ppm and 0.2 Da mass tolerances for MS and MS/MS spectra respectively, cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification, and methionine oxidation as a variable modification. Paragon searches were conducted in “Thorough Mode” using a reversed sequence database to obtain 95 % peptide identification confidence. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://www.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD000963 and doi 10.6019/PXD000963.
Western blotting
Western blot analysis was carried out on proteins extracted from tumor and control regions of FFPE needle biopsies for statistical analysis of protein association with disease outcome. Protein extracts (15–20 µg protein) were resolved by 4–12 % 1D-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-LFP membranes (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 30 V. The membranes were blocked in PBS containing 0.1 % Tween-20 and 0.25 % gelatin for 90 min at room temperature and then probed overnight at room temperature with the following antibodies: ANXA2 (C-10, mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz, sc-28385) 1:100; PSA (C-19, goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz, sc-7638) 1:200; PRDX1 (N-19, goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz, sc-7381) 1:200; AZGP1 (H123, rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz, sc-11358) 1:200. Membranes were then incubated sequentially for 1 h at room temperature with the following fluorophore conjugated secondary antibodies: AlexaFluor®647 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), AlexaFluor®555 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), and AlexaFluor®647 chicken anti-goat IgG (H+L), all 1:2500. Images were acquired immediately after incubation with each secondary antibody using a FLA-5100 fluorescent scanner (FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan), and signal intensity was quantified using ImageJ™ software. Each membrane was also probed for 3 h at room temperature with anti-actin primary antibody (mouse monoclonal, Chemicon, MAB1501) followed by AlexaFluor®555 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) 1:2500. The intensity of each band was measured in triplicate to establish a mean signal intensity and standard deviation for each protein including the actin loading control. The mean values for each protein were normalized to the relevant actin control values and relative abundance changes for each protein were calculated as the ratio of normalized tumor to control tissue signal intensity. Protein abundance analysis was performed without knowledge of disease outcome for each of the clinical samples.
Statistical methods
SPSS software was used for statistical analysis (IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0—August 2013). The association of protein abundance measurements with time to biochemical failure was assessed in a univariate way using the Kaplan–Meier estimator for the survival function with cut-points chosen a priori while multivariate associations with biochemical failure were assessed by application of Cox proportional hazard modeling.
Western blot signals were undetectable in 9.4 % of the 160 individual protein relative abundance measurements (four target proteins plus actin measured in tumor and control tissue for each the 16 cases). Missing values were imputed with a value that was approximately 50 % of the lowest detectable value for any protein in either tissue type.
