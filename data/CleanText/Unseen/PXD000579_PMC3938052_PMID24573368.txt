ABSTRACT:
Oenococcus oeni is the main lactic acid bacterium that carries out the malolactic fermentation in virtually all red wines and in some white and sparkling wines. Oenococcus oeni possesses an array of metabolic activities that can modify the taste and aromatic properties of wine. There is, therefore, industrial interest in the proteins involved in these metabolic pathways and related transport systems of this bacterium. In this work, we report the characterization of the O. oeni ATCC BAA-1163 proteome. Total and membrane protein preparations from O. oeni were standardized and analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Using tandem mass spectrometry, we identified 224 different spots corresponding to 152 unique proteins, which have been classified by their putative function and subjected to bioinformatics analysis.

Material and methods
Bacterial strain and growth conditions
Oenococcus oeni ATCC BAA-1163 (formerly O. oeni IOB 8413,) was grown at 30°C in FT80 broth at pH 5.3, under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroGen 3.5 l, Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK). A draft version of O. oeni ATCC BAA-1163 genome is available under the GenBank accession number AAUV00000000.1. This draft has a GC content of 37.9% and it contains a total of 1398 predicted genes and 280 pseudogenes.
Preparation of protein extracts
Stock culture of O. oeni ATCC BAA-1163 (stored at −80°C) was diluted 1 : 1000 in 1800 ml of fresh medium. When the culture reached the end of the exponential phase (OD620 = 1.2), cells were used to prepare both total and membrane protein extracts. Bacteria were sedimented by centrifugation (11 000×g for 20 min at 4°C) and washed with 200 ml of cold 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M KH2PO4, 0.1 M K2HPO4, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) pH 6.0. The cell pellet then was frozen at −80°C. Experiments were performed in triplicate.
Preparation of total extracts
The frozen pellet was defrosted and resuspended in 60 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer supplemented with 30 µg ml−1 of protease-free DNase I (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), 10 mM MgSO4 (Merck) and 1× concentrate Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Total extracts were obtained by passing the cells four times through a French Press at 12 000 lb in−2. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (1252×g, 15 min, 4°C). The supernatant was designated total protein extracts and frozen at −80°C.
Preparation of membrane extracts
Thirty millilitres of total protein extracts were diluted with 120 ml of 0.1 M sodium carbonate (Merck) pH 11.0, in order to optimize the linearization of membrane vesicles. This solution was gently shaken at 0°C for 1 h then centrifuged at 154 980×g, 40 min at 4°C in a Beckman L8-60M Ultracentrifuge (Type 90 Ti rotor). The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mM Tris/HCl (Merck) pH 7.3, 1 mM MgCl2 (Merck). After another sedimentation by ultracentrifugation (154 980×g, 40 min at 4°C), the membranes were resuspended in 2 ml of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Merck). To increase the proportion of membrane proteins, the membrane extracts were supplemented with 13.3 ml of 2 : 1 v/v trifluoroethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)/chloroform (Merck) and stored on ice for 1 h as reported by Pessione et al.. After centrifugation (10 000×g, 5 min at 4°C), the upper phase was recovered and dried using a vacuum centrifuge. To increase the solubilization of membrane proteins, the samples were treated with the zwitterionic detergent amidosulfobetaine-14 (ASB-14) (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) and tributyl phosphine (TBP) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) by resuspension in the rehydration buffer A (7 M urea (Merck), 2 M thiourea (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA), 1% ASB-14, 40 mM Tris, 2 mM TBP). The samples then were submitted to three cycles of sonication for 30 s and cooling on ice for 30 s. Finally, they were aliquoted and frozen at −80°C.
Protein extraction and determination
The protein preparations were solubilized for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. The total protein concentration present in the extracts was determined by two methods: RC DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) Kit and Quant-iT technology by the use of the Qubit quantification platform (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).
Two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis
Triplicate two-dimensional gels for each sample were carried out as described below: 50 μl aliquots of extracts containing 150 µg of proteins were mixed with a buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 1% carrier ampholytes pH 3–11 (GE Healthcare), up to a final volume of 100 µl, and applied by Cup Loading to 18 cm IPG strips pH 3–11 NL (GE Healthcare) previously rehydrated with 340 µl of the isoelectrofocusing (IEF) buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% carrier ampholites pH 3–11, 1.2% DeStreak (GE Healthcare)). The first dimension was run at 0.05 mA/IPG strip in the IPGphor IEF System (GE Healthcare) with voltage increase in five steps: 300 V h−1 for 3 h, linear gradient up to 1000 V in 6 h, linear gradient up to 8000 V in 3 h and 8000 V h−1 until 42000 V h−1 was reached. After IEF separation, the strips were equilibrated twice for 10 min in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.8), 6 M urea, 30% glycerol (Merck), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; Merck) and trace amounts of bromophenol blue (Sigma-Aldrich). The first equilibration solution contained 1% dithiothreitol (Bio-Rad Laboratories), whereas the second contained 4% iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). The second dimension (SDS-PAGE) was performed on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (1 mm, 16 × 15 cm). Gels were run at 7 mA per gel overnight maintaining buffer temperature at 4°C. Staining was carried out with SYPRO Ruby Protein Gel Stain from Invitrogen as follows: gel was fixed in 10% methanol, 7% acetic acid (Merck) for 30 min, incubated overnight in SYPRO Ruby staining solution, washed twice with 10% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 30 min, and finally washed twice with water for 10 min. Gels were then scanned in a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare) equipped with a 532 nm excitation laser with the emission filter adjusted to 610 nm and 100 µm resolution. The photomultiplier tube settings were modified to optimize sensitivity to background ratios.
The protein spots present in the two-dimensional gels were matched and quantified with the DeCyder v. 7.0 software (GE Healthcare). For this quantification, stained spots were matched in all gels and used for normalization of the average intensity. The selected spots were automatically excised with the Spot Picker (GE Healthcare).
In-gel protein digestion and sample preparation
Two hundred and twenty-four spots of interest from Sypro Ruby-stained two-dimensional gels were excised manually, deposited in 96-well plates and processed automatically in a Proteineer DP (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The digestion protocol used was based on that of Shevchenko et al. with minor variations: gel plugs were washed first with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and then with acetronile (ACN) (Scharlau, Barcelona, Spain) prior to reduction with 10 mM dithiothreitol in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution, and alkylation was carried out with 55 mM iodoacetamine in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution. Gel slices were then rinsed first with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and then with ACN, and finally were dried under a stream of nitrogen. Modified porcine trypsin (sequencing grade; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at a final concentration of 16 ng μl−1 in 25% ACN, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution was added and the digestion took place at 37 °C for 6 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Sigma-Aldrich) for peptide extraction. The tryptic-eluted peptides were dried by speed-vacuum centrifugation and were resuspended in 4 µl of 33% ACN, 16% isopropanol, 0.5% TFA (MALDI solution). A 0.8 µl aliquot of each peptide mixture was deposited onto a 389-well OptiTOF Plate (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA) and allowed to dry at room temperature. A 0.8 µl aliquot of matrix solution (3 mg ml−1 of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Bruker Daltonik) in MALDI solution was then deposited onto dried digest and allowed to dry at room temperature.
MALDI peptide mass fingerprinting, MS/MS analysis and database searching
For MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis, samples were automatically acquired in an ABi 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in positive ion reflector mode (the ion acceleration voltage was 25 kV to MS acquisition and 1 kV to MSMS) and the obtained spectra were stored into the ABi 4000 Series Explorer Spot Set Manager. PMF and MSMS fragment ion spectra were smoothed and corrected to zero baseline using routines embedded in ABi 4000 Series Explorer software v. 3.6. Each PMF spectrum was internally calibrated with the mass signals of trypsin autolysis ions to reach a typical mass measurement accuracy of less than 25 ppm. Known trypsin and keratin mass signals as well as potential sodium and potassium adducts (+21 and +39 Da) were removed from the peak list. To submit the combined PMF and MS/MS data to Mascot software v. 2.1 (Matrix Science, London, UK), GPS Explorer v. 4.9 was used, searching in the non-redundant NCBI protein database. The mass tolerance for precursors was set to ±50 ppm and to ±0.3 Da for MS/MS fragment ions. Peptide identifications were accepted when scored at greater than 95.0% probability by the Mascot algorithm.
