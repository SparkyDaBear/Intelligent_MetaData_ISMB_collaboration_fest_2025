ABSTRACT:
Mutations in the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase domain occur in 10–30% of lung adenocarcinoma and are associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sensitivity. We sought to identify the immediate direct and indirect phosphorylation targets of mutant EGFRs in lung adenocarcinoma. We undertook stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) strategy, phosphopeptide enrichment, and quantitative mass spectrometry to identify dynamic changes of phosphorylation downstream of mutant EGFRs in lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFRL858R and EGFRL858R/T790M, the TKI-sensitive and -resistant mutations, respectively. Top canonical pathways that were inhibited upon erlotinib treatment in sensitive cells, but not in the resistant cells include EGFR, Insulin receptor, HGF, MAPK, mTOR, p70S6K and JAK/STAT signaling. We identified phosphosites in proteins of the autophagy network, such as ULK1 (S623) that is constitutively phosphorylated in these lung adenocarcinoma cells; phosphorylation is inhibited upon erlotinib treatment in sensitive cells, but not in resistant cells. Finally, kinase-substrate prediction analysis from our data indicated that substrates of basophilic kinase families, AGC, CAMK and STE were significantly enriched and those of proline directed kinase families, CMGC and CK were significantly depleted among substrates that exhibited increased phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation and reduced phosphorylation upon TKI inhibition. This is the first study to date to examine global phosphorylation changes upon erlotinib treatment of lung adenocarcinoma cells and results from this study provide new insights into signaling downstream of mutant EGFRs in lung adenocarcinoma.
METHODS:
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Cell Culture and preparation of lysates
Two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, H3255 harboring EGFR L858R mutation (a kind gift from Dr. Bruce Johnson at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) and H1975 with EGFR L858R/T790M mutation (purchased from American Type Culture Collection) were used in this study. These cells were cultured in RPMI SILAC media at 37°C, 5% CO2 and high humidity in accordance with the previously described protocol. Briefly, 3-state SILAC media were prepared by supplementing different isotopic versions of 1.15 mM arginine and 0.274 mM lysine. Light media was made using light arginine and lysine, medium state contained 13C6 arginine and 4,4,5,5-D4 lysine, and heavy media contained 13C615N4 arginine and 13C615N2 lysine. All amino acids (99% pure) were purchased from either Cambridge Isotope laboratories (Andover, MA) or from Sigma-Aldrich, (St. Louis, MO). The cells were passaged at least five times and screened for labeling efficiency using mass spectrometry. Upon completion of labeling, cells were expanded into several 15 cm dishes. Cells (~5×107–108 per dish) were serum starved for 14 hours prior to treatment. Light cells were left untreated as the control, the medium labelled cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF (Millipore) for three minutes and the heavy cells were treated with erlotinib (Genentech) to a final concentration of 100 nM for one hour before stimulating the cells with 100 ng/ml EGF for three minutes. The reaction was terminated by chilling cells quickly with cold PBS; for phosphopeptide profiling, cells were lysed in urea lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 8 M urea, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mM β-glycerophosphate. Cells were sonicated using Branson 250 Sonifier at 20% pulse for 5 sec, 3 times on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000g for 10 min and protein concentration in the supernatant was measured using modified Lowry method (BioRad). Equal amounts of protein from lysates of each state were combined. For Western blot based validation experiments unlabelled cells (control, treated with erlotinib and EGF) were lysed with modified RIPA buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche), 1 mM Na3VO4, and NaF 1 mM.
2.2 Tryptic digestion of proteins and purification of digested peptides
Lysates from the three SILAC states (serum starved, EGF stimulated, and TKI inhibited/EGF stimulated) were combined to constitute 20–30 mg of pooled lysate that was homogenized and centrifuged at 15,000×g followed by reduction and alkylation with 45 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma Aldrich, MO) and 100 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma Aldrich, MO), respectively. Modified sequencing grade Trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to carry out digestion of the lysate at 30°C for 16 hrs. The digest was then acidified using 0.1% TFA and the tryptic peptides were cleaned using solid phase C18 extraction column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), dried down in a lyophilizer, and subsequently subjected to strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography or basic reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC).
2.3 Strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography for fractionation of tryptic peptides
SCX was performed using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) using a polysulfoethyl A SCX column (PolyLC, Columbia, MD; 200 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm, 200Å) as described earlier. Lyophilized tryptic peptides were resuspended in SCX Buffer A (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 30% acetonitrile (ACN), pH 2.7), loaded onto SCX column and eluted over a gradient of SCX buffer B (Buffer A containing 350 mM KCl); 0–50% buffer B over a period of 30 min followed by 50–100% B for 7 min, and 100% B for 3 min. A gradient cycle time of 50 min was used. A total of 24 fractions were collected based on UV absorbance profile and the fractionated peptides were dried in a vacuum centrifuge.
2.4 Basic reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) fractionation and concatenation of peptide fractions
Basic RPLC separation was performed with a XBridge C18, 250 × 4.6 mm analytical column containing 5μm particles and equipped with a 20 × 4.6 mm guard column (Waters, Milford, MA) with a flow rate of 1mL/min. The solvent consisted of 7 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEABC) as mobile phase A, and 7 mM TEABC and 90% ACN as mobile phase B. Sample separation was accomplished using the following linear gradient: from 0 to 1% B in 5min, from 1 to 10% B in 5min, from 10 to 35% B in 30min, and from 35 to 100% B in 5min, and held at 100% B for an additional 3min. A total of 96 fractions were collected during the LC separation in a 96-well plate in the presence of 50μL of 1% formic acid. The collected fractions were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Finally the samples were concatenated into 12 fractions by combining fractions 1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85; and so on.
2.4 Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) Enrichment
Dried peptides dissolved in solution A containing 80% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoracetic acid and 3% 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and incubated with titanium dioxide (TiO2) (Titansphere, GL Sciences) pretreated (2hrs at room temperature) with solution A. After 12 hrs, TiO2 beads were washed thrice using solution A and twice with 80% acetonitrile containing 1% trifluoracetic acid. TiO2 bound peptides were eluted using 3% NH4OH in 40% ACN and immediately acidified using formic acid. The peptides were vacuum dried, C18 stage-tip cleaned before LC-MS/MS analysis.
2.5 LC-MS/MS analyses
Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of SILAC labelled peptides obtained from SCX chromatography followed by TiO2 enrichment were carried out on a LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer interfaced with a Eksigent nanoflow liquid chromatography system and an Agilent 1100 microwell plate autosampler. Magic C18 AQ 5 μm, 100Å from Michrom Bioresources was used for packing nanoflow reversed-phase columns. Peptides were loaded onto a trap column (75 μm × 2 cm) and separated on an analytical column (75μm × 15 cm) at 300 nL/min flow rate for 75–120 min duration. The data dependent LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out by acquiring FT-MS at a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400 and MS/MS of eight most abundant ions in ion trap. Multistage activation mode was enabled with neutral loss masses of 32.66, 48.99 and 97.97. Fragmented ions were excluded dynamically for 90 seconds.
Peptides separated/fractionated by basic reversed-phase chromatography followed by TiO2 enrichment were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite interfaced with an Easy-nLC 1000 RPLC (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). The enriched phosphopeptides were loaded onto a nano-trap column (Acclaim PepMap100 Nano Trap Column, C18, 5 μm, 100 Å, 100 μm i.d. × 2 cm) and separated on a nano-LC column (Acclaim PepMap100, C18, 3 μm, 100 Å, 75 μm i.d. × 25 cm, nanoViper). Mobile phases A and B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in 90% ACN, respectively. Peptides were eluted from the column at 300 nL/min using the following linear gradient: from 2 to 8% B in 5min, from 8 to 32% B in 100min, from 32 to 100% B in 10min, and held at 100% B for an additional 10min. The heated capillary temperature and spray voltage were 275°C and 2.2kV, respectively. Full spectra were collected from m/z 350 to 1800 in the Orbitrap analyzer at a resolution of 120,000, followed by data-dependent HCD MS/MS scans of the ten most abundant ions, using 32% collision energy and dynamic exclusion time of 30s.
2.6 Data Analysis
Peptides and proteins were identified and quantified using the Maxquant software package (version 1.3.0.5) with the Andromeda search engine as well as Proteome Discoverer with Mascot and Sequest search engines (Thermo Scientific). MS/MS data were searched against the Refseq 49 human protein database and quantification was performed using default parameters for three-state SILAC in MaxQuant. Parameters for data analysis included trypsin as a protease with two allowable missed cleavages. Carbamidomethyl cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. Phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation were specified as variable modifications. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 7 ppm and fragment mass tolerance to 20 ppm. False discovery rate was calculated using a decoy database and a 1% FDR cut off was applied. Phosphorylation motifs for serine and threonine phosphorylation sites were aligned using PhosphoSite Plus using the Motif-All algorithm to search the observed sites weighted by a database of known phospho serine/threonine sites.
2.7 GPS analysis
We determined putative kinase targets among all the identified phosphosites using the Group-based Prediction System 2.1.2 (GPS). Predictions of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites were done for 408 human protein kinases based on preferable peptide substrate sequences with theoretically calculated maximal false positive rate of 6% for serine-threonine kinases and of 9% for tyrosine kinases. We applied Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment using R statistics package to determine the enrichment or depletion of number of substrates of kinase family, subfamily, and individual kinases for the set of phosphosites hyperphosphorylated after EGF stimulation (EGF/Control, M/L > 1.5) and for the set of phosphosites sensitive to erlotinib treatment (EGF + erlotinib/EGF, H/M < 0.67) in comparison with the corresponding baselines (0.67 < M/L < 1.5 and 0.67 < H/M < 1.5). Data representation on the kinome tree was adapted from Manning et. al. and the Kinome Render software.
2.8 Immunoblot analysis
For Western blot analysis, 50–100 μg of lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking in 5% BSA in PBST for one hour, membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody followed by secondary antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase. The primary antibodies used were against mTOR, pmTOR (S2248), RSK2, pRSK2 (S380), ERK1/2, pERK1 (T202/Y204), AKT1 and pAKT1 (S473), purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Andover, MA). Actin was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, MO. Custom mouse monoclonal antibodies were made against EGFRL858R, that recognizes mutant EGFR, but not WT EGFR, and against EGFRL858, that recognizes wild type EGFR, but not mutant EGFR in collaboration with NanoTools (Germany). Membranes were incubated with ECL (Amersham) for 5 minutes prior to exposing to X-ray film.
