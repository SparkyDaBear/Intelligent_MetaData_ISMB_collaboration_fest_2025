ABSTRACT:
We report a global quantitative phosphoproteomic study of bloodstream and procyclic form Trypanosoma brucei using SILAC labeling of each lifecycle stage. Phosphopeptide enrichment by SCX and TiO2 led to the identification of a total of 10096 phosphorylation sites on 2551 protein groups and quantified the ratios of 8275 phosphorylation sites between the two lifecycle stages. More than 9300 of these sites (92%) have not previously been reported. Model-based gene enrichment analysis identified over representation of Gene Ontology terms relating to the flagella, protein kinase activity, and the regulation of gene expression. The quantitative data reveal that differential protein phosphorylation is widespread between bloodstream and procyclic form trypanosomes, with significant intraprotein differential phosphorylation. Despite a lack of dedicated tyrosine kinases, 234 phosphotyrosine residues were identified, and these were 3–4 fold over-represented among site changing >10-fold between the two lifecycle stages. A significant proportion of the T. brucei kinome was phosphorylated, with evidence that MAPK pathways are functional in both lifecycle stages. Regulation of gene expression in T. brucei is exclusively post-transcriptional, and the extensive phosphorylation of RNA binding proteins observed may be relevant to the control of mRNA stability in this organism.

Experimental Section
Cell Culture Media
HMI9-T, a modification of the original IMDM-based HMI-9, uses 56 μM 1-thioglycerol in place of 200 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM glutaMAX I (Invitrogen) in place of 4 mM l-glutamine, and contains 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (PAA). Similarly, HMI11-T is a modification of the original HMI11 (HMI-9 lacking serum plus) that use 56 μM 1-thioglycerol and 2 mM glutaMAX I with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.
HMI11-SILAC – RK was prepared in the same way as HMI11-T but using IMDM depleted of l-Arginine, l-Lysine (Sigma) and 10% dialyzed heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10 kDa molecular weight cutoff, PAA) and was supplemented with 4 mg/L folic acid. The HMI11-SILAC – RK was supplemented with either normal l-Arginine and l-Lysine (HMI11-SILAC + R0K0), or with l-Arginine U–13C6 and l-Lysine 4,4,5,5-2H4 (HMI11-SILAC + R6K4, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at 30% of the original HMI11 concentration (120 and 240 μM respectively) unless otherwise stated. Original SDM-79 medium and SILAC SDM-79 medium (SDM-79 + R6K6) were prepared as described previously.
Cell Culture
Procyclic form Trypanosoma brucei Lister 427 clone 29.13.6 cells were grown at 28 °C without CO2 in SDM-79 in the presence of 15 μg/mL G418 and 50 μg/mL hygromycin. Culture adapted strain Lister 427 monomorphic bloodstream form T. brucei (MITat 1.2, expressing VSG221) were cultured in HMI-9T containing 2.5 μg/mL G418 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Both cell lines have been genetically modified to express the T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor protein, as described by Wirtz et al. Cell dimensions were measured using a CASY cell counter.
For the growth curves, the T. brucei bloodstream form cells were washed twice in 10 mL HMI11-SILAC – RK and resuspended at 5 × 104 cells/mL in either HMI-9T or HMI11-SILAC supplemented with R0K0 at 30% of the original HMI11 concentration. Cells were counted using a Neubauer chamber and phase contrast microscope, and the cultures were diluted 100-fold every two days. After 10 days samples were collected for analysis by light microscopy.
For SILAC labeling, T. brucei bloodstream form log-phase cells were diluted 10000-fold into HMI11-SILAC + R6K4. Cells were harvested after 3 days growth at 2.5 × 106 cells/mL. SILAC labeling of T. brucei procyclic form cells was performed in SDM-79 + R6K6 as described previously.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation and hypotonically lysed at 5 × 109 cells/mL for 5 min on ice in the presence 0.1 μM 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptone (TLCK), 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenyl-methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 μg/mL aprotinin and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture II (Calbiochem). The protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce) to be ∼5 mg/mL from each cell type. Samples were aliquoted, snap frozen, and stored at −80 °C prior to subsequent processing.
Microscopy
Bloodstream form cells at late log phase grown in either HMI9-T or HMI11-SILAC + R0K0 for 10 days were washed in 10 mL phosphate buffer saline at 800 × g at 4 °C, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min, and placed on a coverslip. After air-drying the coverslips were washed in phosphate buffered saline and mounted onto slides. The phase contrast images were collected in a Zeiss Axioplan microscope.
Estimating Efficiency of SILAC Labeling
Bloodstream form cells were grown in HMI11-SILAC + R6K4 for 11–12 cell divisions and hypotonically lysed as described above. To reduce the sample complexity the proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and a band corresponding to 25–50 kDa molecular weight range was excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digest prior to analysis by LC–MS/MS. Ten peptides were chosen at random and the relative abundance of the major isotopic peak of heavy (arginine-13C6/lysine-2H4) and light (arginine-12C6/lysine-1H4) forms were measured using the extracted ion chromatogram function in Excalibur (Thermo Scientific).
Rodent Infectivity Studies
Bloodstream form cells were grown in HMI9-T or HMI11-SILAC + R0K0 for >14 days prior to inoculation of female Balbc mice (three per condition) by inter peritoneal injection of 1 × 103, 1 × 104 or 1 × 105 cells in the same media. Daily tail bleeds were used to monitor the number of parasites in the bloodstream using a heamocytometer, and animals were euthanized when the parasite burden exceeded 5 × 108 cells/mL prior to overt distress.
Comparative Proteomic Analysis
A 1:1 mix of procyclic form cells grown in light-SILAC media and bloodstream form cells grown in heavy-SILAC media was solubilized with SDS and tryptic peptides were generated by FASP. Peptides were fractionated by SCX prior to analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry as described previously, except only 6 SCX fractions were analyzed and technical duplicates were not performed. The previously reported the analysis of a 1:1 mix of procyclic form cells grown in heavy-SILAC media and bloodstream form cells grown in light-SILAC media, consisting of technical duplicates of eight SCX fractions and ten SDS-PAGE fractions, was reprocessed to ensure accurate comparison with the current data.
Filter Aided Sample Preparation
Peptide samples for analysis by mass spectrometry were prepared by modification of the filter-aided sample preparation procedure (FASP). Briefly, samples were defrosted and combined according to the experiment design to give a total of 2.5 × 109 lysed cells (0.5 mL), solubilized with 4% SDS and then reductively alkylated in a 30000 molecular weight cutoff vertical spin filtration unit (Vivascience) using the FASP procedure adapted for the larger volumes used here. The sample was digested with 1:100 ratio (w/w) of trypsin gold (Promega) in the filtration unit for 18 h at 37 °C, tryptic peptides were eluted by centrifugation, and the filter washed sequentially with 1 mL of 50 mM NH4HCO3 and 1 mL of 0.5 M NaCl. The combined eluent was desalted using a 500 mg C18 cartridge (SepPak, Waters) and lyophilized.
Strong Cation Exchange Chromatography
Strong cation exchange (SCX) was performed on an Agilent 1120 compact LC using a 3.0 × 200 mm 5 μm polysulfethyl aspartamide column (Poly LC) with a flow rate of 350 μL/min and detection at 220 nm. Phosphopeptides were enriched using the method of Beausoleil et al. Dried peptides were dissolved in 200 μL of solvent A (5 mM KHPO4 pH 2.7, 30% MeCN) and separated by salt gradient consisting of 5 min at 100% solvent A, a 15 min gradient to 15% solvent B (solvent A + 0.35 M KCl), 1 min gradient to 100% B, 15 min at 100% B, and a 5 min gradient to 100% A. Fractions of 0.7 mL were collected throughout the run and combined into 8 fractions of equal peptide content based on their absorbance at 220 nm. Combined fractions were lyophilized prior to TiO2 enrichment.
TiO2 Enrichment of Phosphopeptides
Phosphopeptides were enriched using TiO2 in batch mode in the presence of 5% TFA and 1 M glycolic acid. Briefly, lyophilized peptides were resuspended in 80% MeCN, 5% TFA, 1 M glycolic acid prior to incubation for 15 min with TiO2 beads (GL Sciences) that were prewashed in the same solution. Beads were recovered by centrifugation at 700 × g for 1 min, washed three times in 80% MeCN, 5% TFA and eluted twice in 0.6% NH3 (aq). The combined eluents were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C prior to analysis.
Mass Spectrometry Data Acquisition
Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was performed by the FingerPrints Proteomic Facility at the University of Dundee. Liquid chromatography was performed on a fully automated Ultimate U3000 Nano LC System (Dionex) fitted with a 1 × 5 mm PepMap C18 trap column and a 75 μm × 15 cm reverse phase PepMap C18 nanocolumn (LC Packings, Dionex). Samples were loaded in 0.1% formic acid (buffer A) and separated using a binary gradient consisting of buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (90% MeCN, 0.08% formic acid). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 5 to 40% buffer B over 65 min. The HPLC system was coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a Proxeon nanospray ion source. For phosphoproteomic analysis, the mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent mode to perform a survey scan over a range 335–1800 m/z in the Orbitrap analyzer (R = 60000), with each MS scan triggering 15 MS2 acquisitions of the 15 most intense ions using multistage activation on the neutral loss of 98 and 49 thomsons in the LTQ ion trap. The Orbitrap mass analyzer was internally calibrated on the fly using the lock mass of polydimethylcyclosiloxane at m/z 445.120025.
For proteomic analysis, the HPLC gradient was increased to 145 min and the mass spectrometer was operated in data dependent mode with each MS scan triggering 15 MS2 acquisitions of the 15 most intense ions in the LTQ ion trap.
Data Processing
Data was processed using MaxQuant version 1.3.0.5 which incorporates the Andromeda search engine. Proteins were identified by searching a protein sequence database containing T. brucei brucei 927 annotated proteins (Version 4.0, downloaded from TriTrypDB,) supplemented with the VSG221 sequence and frequently observed contaminants (porcine trypsin, bovine serum albumins and mammalian keratins) that contains a total of 10,081 protein sequences. Search parameters specified an MS tolerance of 6 ppm, an MS/MS tolerance at 0.5 Da and full trypsin specificity, allowing for up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionines, N-terminal protein acetylation and N-pyroglutamate were allowed as variable modifications. Phosphoproteomic analysis included phosophorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine as additional variable modifications. Peptides were required to be at least 7 amino acids in length and a MaxQuant score >5, with false discovery rates (FDRs) of 0.01 calculated at the levels of peptides, proteins and modification sites based on the number of hits against the reversed sequence database. SILAC ratios were calculated using only peptides that could be uniquely mapped to a given protein group, and required a minimum of two SILAC pairs. To account for any errors in the counting of the number of cells mixed, the distribution of SILAC ratios was normalized within MaxQuant at the peptide level so that the median of log2 ratios is zero, as described by Cox et al.
Prior to statistical analysis, the outputs from MaxQuant were filtered to remove known contaminants and reverse sequences, and phosphorylation sites with a MaxQuant localization probability <0.95 were discarded. This localization probability cut off was chosen following the manual inspection of the tandem mass spectra showing the best localization evidence for phosphorylation sites occurring on protein kinases.
Quantitation of the changes in abundance are derived from the two SILAC labeled experiments with a 1:1 mix of procyclic form cells grown in heavy-SILAC media and bloodstream cells grown in light-SILAC media, and the label swap experiment with the SILAC labeling reversed. SILAC ratios for phosphorylation sites were calculated using only data from the phosphoproteomic experiments, and SILAC ratios for proteins were calculated using only data from the nonenriched proteomic experiments. When SILAC ratios were reported in both label swap experiments, replicate trimming was applied by calculating the mean and standard deviation σ of the distribution of the log2 (H/L × L/H), and discarding data >2σ from the mean (Figure 3). Where SILAC ratios were reported in only one experiment, they were discarded if the percentage variation in the calculated SILAC ratio (calculated by MaxQuant) was >100%.
The Mascot Delta Score was calculated by determining the difference between the best and second best Mascot ion scores for alternative phosphorylation site localizations on an otherwise identical peptide sequence, and appended to the MaxQuant outputs. Mascot distiller was used to peak pick mass spectra and read the centroid data from raw tandem mass spectra and submit searches to Mascot (Server version 2.2) using the same sequence database, enzyme specificity, modifications and mass tolerance as described above.
Data was visualized using Perseus 1.3.0.4 () and further information on the identified proteins was obtained from TriTrypDB (). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment was carried out using model based gene set analysis or term for term enrichment in Ontologiser using a T. brucei specific GO set containing 16765 terms for 4340 genes obtained from GeneDB (). To make our data accessible to the scientific community, we uploaded our study to TriTrypDB and deposited the Thermo RAW files and search engine output into ProteomeXchange () accession number PXD000049, enabling researchers to access the data presented here.
