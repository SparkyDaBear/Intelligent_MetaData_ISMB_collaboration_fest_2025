ABSTRACT:
Cytoskeletal dynamics during cell behaviours ranging from endocytosis and exocytosis to cell division and movement is controlled by a complex network of signalling pathways, the full details of which are as yet unresolved. Here we show that SILAC-based proteomic methods can be used to characterize the rapid chemoattractant-induced dynamic changes in the actin–myosin cytoskeleton and regulatory elements on a proteome-wide scale with a second to minute timescale resolution. This approach provides novel insights in the ensemble kinetics of key cytoskeletal constituents and association of known and novel identified binding proteins. We validate the proteomic data by detailed microscopy-based analysis of in vivo translocation dynamics for key signalling factors. This rapid large-scale proteomic approach may be applied to other situations where highly dynamic changes in complex cellular compartments are expected to play a key role.
 Actin-dependent motility is driven by the rapid changes in the recruitment of many different structural and regulatory proteins at the cell’s cortex. Sobczyk et al. characterize these changes in the cytoskeletal proteome on a second to minute timescale during chemotactic response in Dictyostelium using SILAC-based proteomics.

Cell growth and stimulation in the SILAC experiments
Dictyostelium Ax2 cells were grown in suspension until the populations went through six cell doublings. One population was grown in a ‘light’ SIH medium and the other in a ‘heavy’ medium with L-lysine and L-arginine substituted with K8 L-lysine and R6 L-arginine. Cells were harvested at the density of 5 × 106 cells per ml, washed twice with development buffer (5 mM KH2PO4 5 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.4 mM CaCl2, pH 6.2) and resuspended in DB at the density of 1 × 107 cells per ml. Cells were developed on a rotary shaker for 5 h by pulsing with 30 nM final concentration of cAMP at 6-min intervals. Developed cells were washed once with DB without calcium (DB−Ca++: 5 mM KH2PO4 5 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM MgSO4, pH 6.2) containing 1 mM EGTA, then once with DB-Ca++ and resuspended at the final density of 2 × 107 cells per ml in DB-Ca++ cooled to 12 °C containing 3 mM caffeine to inhibit endogenous cAMP oscillations. After 20 min incubation at 12 °C, the ‘light’ cells were transferred to a 50-ml falcon tube and placed in a 12 °C water bath on a magnetic stirrer rotating at about 300 r.p.m. in a 4 °C cold room. Cells were stimulated with cAMP at a final concentration of 5 × 10−4 M. Five-hundred microliter samples were transferred into 2-ml tubes containing 500 μl of ice-cold 2 × lysis buffer (1 × LB: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA pH 8, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 × protease inhibitors cocktail) shaking on a horizontal mixer (IKA, Vibrax VXR). Samples were taken before and 1, 4, 10, 20, 60, 120 and 180 s after the cAMP stimulation. One ml of the ‘heavy’ cell lysate, prepared by mixing 5 ml of unstimulated ‘heavy’ cells with 5 ml of ice-cold 2 × LB and vortexing for 20 s, was transferred into each ‘light’ sample. The resulting mixed lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 20,000 g at 2 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 × protease inhibitors cocktail) and transferred into 1.5 ml protein LoBind (Eppendorf) tubes and centrifuged again as above. The resulting pellets were frozen until further processing.
Cross-linked SILAC protocol
All the cell growth and development conditions were the same as described above. In the cross-linked SILAC experiment, the stimulation of ‘light’ cells was repeated four times. A total of 125 μl samples were collected for each time point in each stimulation and lysed with equal volume of ice-cold 2 × fixing lysis buffer (1 × : 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2 mM EGTA pH 8, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1% formaldehyde) and kept on ice for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by adding Tris-HCl pH 8 to the final concentration of 350 mM. The lysates of corresponding time points from all 4 stimulation experiments were pooled. The ‘heavy’ cell lysate was prepared as described above but with Fixing LB and was incubated on ice for 30 min and quenched as above before mixing with the pooled ‘light’ cell lysates. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of wash buffer. For the reversal of formaldehyde, cross-linking samples were boiled with sample buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8, 4% SDS, 25 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, 4.5% glycerol) at 99 °C for 40 min.
Determination of cytoskeletal enrichment factor
All the cell growth and development conditions were the same as described above. After development 1 × 107 cells from the ‘heavy’ population was centrifuged and lysed in 20 μl of 1.5 × Turbo DNase buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. 3 × 107 cells from the ‘light’ population was centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of DB-Ca++and lysed by mixing with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 2 × LB. Insoluble fraction was centrifuged and washed once with 1 ml of wash buffer. Final pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 1.5 × Turbo DNase buffer. Two units of Turbo DNase and 100 ng of RNase A were added to both samples, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were solubilized by adding 10 μl of 4 × SB without DTT and protein concentration was determined using DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Hundred microgram of proteins from both samples were mixed and processed following the standard procedure described below with increased fractionation into 24 instead of 12 fractions.
Sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis
The pellets (~7 μl) were resuspended in 12 μl of 1.5 × Turbo DNase buffer supplemented with 1 × protease inhibitors cocktail containing 2 units of Turbo DNase and 100 ng of RNase A and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were then mixed with 7 μl of 4 × SB and boiled at 96 °C for 6 min. Proteins were alkylated with 3 μl of fresh 1 M iodoacetamide by incubating at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Ten microliters of 4 × urea buffer (1 × UB: 100 mM Tris pH 8, 1% SDS, 2 M urea, 4.5% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue) was added to obtain the final sample volume of ~40 μl.
Proteins were separated on 10 well, 1.5-mm thick, NuPAGE 4–12% bis-tris gradient gels and stained with Novex colloidal blue staining kit in a sterile 14 cm tissue culture dish. Sample lanes were cut into 12 fractions and each gel fraction was further cut into 1 × 1 mm cubes and transferred into individual 1.5 ml Protein LoBind tube. Gel pieces were washed with 500 μl of 40 mM (NH4)2CO3 and mixed on a horizontal mixer at 1,500 r.p.m. for 15 min. A quantity of 500 μl of CH3CN was added and samples were incubated at 45 °C for 2 h with periodic mixing. The supernatant was discarded and 250 μl of CH3CN was added to dehydrate the gel pieces for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge (Thermo Scientific, Savant SPD131DDA) for 10 min. Dried gel pieces were covered with 50 μl of 40 mM (NH4)2CO3 containing 10 μg ml−1 of Trypsin Gold and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to rehydrate. Between 30 and 100 μl of 40 mM (NH4)2CO3 was used to cover the gel pieces completely and samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight.
Peptides were extracted with equal volumes (80–150 μl) of 50% CH3CN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid by incubating at 45 °C for 3 h with periodic mixing on a horizontal mixer at 1,500 r.p.m. Supernatants were transferred to fresh Protein LoBind tubes and 400 μl of 50% CH3CN/0.1% TFA was added to the gel pieces followed by incubation at 45 °C for 2 h with periodic mixing. Combined supernatants were evaporated in a vacuum centrifuge at 45 °C until fully dry. Dried peptides were resuspended in 15 μl of 0.1% TFA and purified using ZipTip C-18 peptide purification microcolumns following the recommended procedure. Final peptide concentration was measured using LavaPep peptide quantification kit and 1 μg of peptides was used for mass spectrometry analysis. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis were performed using Ultimate 3000 nano-HPLC system (Dionex) coupled through nanoelectrospray ionization emitter (New Objective) with LTQ-Velos Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 150 mm × 75 μm Acclaim PepMap C-18 reverse phase column (Dionex) over a 100 min run with a flow rate of 300 nl min−1 of organic gradient. After leaving the column peptides were ionized with nanoelectrospray at 1.2 kV.
Proteomic data analysis
Raw MS and MS/MS data were processed and quantified using MaxQuant version 1.0.13.13 software and Mascot Daemon version 2.3.2 (Matrix Science) was used to search peptides in the Dictyostelium protein database. Data were analysed with the following settings: two missed cleavages allowed, enzyme used was trypsin, 0.5 kDa mass tolerance for fragment ions, maximum 0.05 PEP value for peptide identification. One fixed modification: Carbamidomethylation (C); and few variable modifications were selected: Oxidation (M); acetylation (N-term); phosphorylation (S,T,Y). Protein ratios were determined based on a minimum of two peptide ratios using razor and unique peptides.
Detected proteins were annotated in Excel with Gene Ontology annotations and detailed protein information obtained from the DictyBase. Only proteins that had ratios quantified in at least four time points per experiment were filtered for further analysis. For each protein the L/H ratios were first normalized to their average value over the time series in each experiment and then two replica experiments were merged by averaging ratios for each time point and s.e. were calculated. The final protein ratio series were normalized to the pre-stimulation time point whenever available, and s.e. were recalculated. Time series from the cross-linked SILAC were normalized to the pre-stimulation values whenever available. Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the temporal profiles from different SILAC experiment was calculated and used to filter the proteins based on the reproducibility of the results. In order to estimate the measurement background noise we analysed profiles of over 100 proteins that were expected to be detected but not responding to the chemoattractant stimulation, such as subunits of nucleopore, histone variants and porins. These relatively abundant proteins showed average changes around 15% of the pre-stimulation values with standard deviations (s.d.) around 8–12% at different time points. These fluctuations were considered a good representation of the measurement background noise and only changes at least two s.d. higher than this level, which corresponds to around 35% of the pre-stimulation values, were considered reliable. The final normalized and filtered time series were analysed using Cluster3 software by centroid linkage clustering using City-Block distance as a similarity metric. Heat-maps were generated using the Java TreeView software.
Phalloidin actin polymerization assay
To measure the actin polymerization in response to cAMP stimulation, we used a modified version of the method previously described. Cells grown in HL-5 medium were harvested at the density of 4 × 106 cells per ml and were developed and stimulated as described above. Stimulation was performed at 12 °C water bath in the cold room. A total of 200 μl samples collected before and in various time points after the cAMP stimulation were lysed with equal volumes of ice-cold 2 × fixing LB containing 500 nM Phalloidin-TRITC. Lysates were mixed on a horizontal mixer at 700 r.p.m. in the dark at RT for 2 h. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 g at 10 °C for 10 min. Phalloidin-TRITC was extracted from the pellets with 500 μl of methanol for 1 h at RT on a horizontal mixer. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 g at RT for 2 min and two replicas of 200 μl for each time point were transferred to a 96-well flat transparent microtiter plate. Rhodamine fluorescence was measured using microtiter plate fluorometer (Anthos2001, Anthos Labtech) with 540 nm excitation filter and 575 nm emission filter.
Construction of GFP expression vectors
We have modified the Dictyostelium discoideum extra-chromosomal amino- and carboxy-terminal GFP expression vectors pDM317 and pDM323 (ref.) by introducing new restriction sites and extending the linker region followed by introduction of a LifeAct-RFP expression cassette under the control of the actin15 promoter. The linker region was changed by adding AgeI restriction site between the two existing sites for BglII and SpeI in the multiple cloning sites. At the same time, the linker fragment between the insert and the C-term GFP tag on pDM323 was extended from four amino acids (ThrSerSerGly) to eight amino acids (ThrSerAlaGlyAlaSerSerGly). The five amino acid linker (SerGlyLeuArgSer) on pDM317 was not modified. These modifications were made by inserting short fragments of dsDNA formed from oligos with cohesive ends compatible with BglII and SpeI restriction sites present on the vectors. The mRFPmars-LifeAct (RFP-LifeAct) expression cassette was created by inserting dsDNA fragment encoding 20 aa long LifeAct probe into the BglII and SpeI sites on pDM318 with N-term mRFPmars tag. The whole expression cassette with act15 promotor, RFP-LifeAct construct and act8 terminator was amplified by PCR using high fidelity KOD polymerase with primers introducing NgoMIV restriction sites at the ends of the cassette. The NgoMIV digested, purified PCR product was cloned into the NgoMIV restriction site on the modified pDM317 and pDM323 vectors.
Molecular cloning procedures
Genes selected for cloning were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using KOD polymerase and primers, which introduced restriction sites at the ends of the PCR products (see Supplementary Table 1). Each forward primer contained restriction site for BglII or one of the enzymes generating compatible cohesive ends: BamHI or BclI. Several genes, which had internal sites for all the above restriction enzymes, were cloned using AgeI site. Reverse primers were carrying restriction sites for SpeI or XbaI or NheI. All the restriction sites on the primers were flanked with five base fragments to allow efficient digest of the PCR products. Primers were designed to have the annealing temperature of 54 °C. All the genes were amplified using standard PCR conditions with 24 cycles, annealing temperature of 50 °C, annealing time of 15 s, extension temperature of 68 °C and extension time of 40 s per kb. For a few genes the number of cycles was increased up to 28. Reactions were performed in 50 μl with 30 ng of genomic DNA and 0.5 unit of KOD polymerase in Eppendorf Mastercycler ep Gradient S.
PCR products were purified and digested simultaneously with two restriction enzymes appropriate for each construct’s design after restriction digest samples were purified again and the DNA concentration was measured with NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). These final samples were ligated into previously generated vectors, which were digested with SpeI and BglII or AgeI and dephosphorylated with Antarctic phosphatase. A quantity of 30 ng of plasmid DNA was mixed with approximately two molar excess of insert DNA in 5 μl samples. Ligations were performed using 0.5 unit of T4 DNA ligase at 16 °C overnight and the whole sample volumes were used for transformation of chemo-competent DH5 Escherichia coli cells. Generated clones were screened by colony PCR with primers amplifying the whole insert with GFP-tag and the final constructs were verified by restriction analyses.
Construction of docA and docB knockout constructs
DocA (DDB_G0291974) 1361–4205, bp sequence was amplified and cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen). To make the disruption construct the hygromycin cassette was cut from pHygAK-REMI/TOPO by XbaI and SacI and was cloned blunt end into the BaeI site in docA sequence. DocB (DDB_G0270404) 5245–6755, bp sequence was amplified and cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO. To make the disruption construct the Cre-BSR cassette was cut from pLPBLP by SmaI and cloned blunt end into the BstBI site in docB. The disruption constructs were amplified by PCR using the same primers (see Supplementary Table 1) and transfected into Ax2 cells followed by selection with hygromycin (50 μg ml−1) and blasticidin (7.5 μg ml−1), respectively. Transformants were selected and targeted integration was checked by PCR and southern blot.
Dictyostelium transfection
AX2 cells were grown in a shaking culture in HL-5 medium up to 4 × 106 cells per ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 600 g for 2 min, washed two times with ice-cold H-50 buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 5 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7) and resuspended in H-50 buffer at the density of 5 × 107 cells per ml. A quantity of 100 μl of this cell suspension was mixed with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and transferred to an ice-cold 0.1 cm electroporation cuvette. Cells were electroporated with two 0.65 kV pulses at 25 μF capacitance with 5-s interval. Cuvettes were incubated on ice for 5 min and the cells were transferred to HL-5 medium with ampicillin and streptomycin. To select stable transformants, G418 was added 6–12 h after transfection to a final concentration of 30 μg ml−1.
In vivo fluorescence microscopy
Cells from each strain were developed as described before. After development, cells were washed once with DB-Ca++containing 1 mM EGTA then with DB and resuspended in DB with 3 mM caffeine. Hundred microliters of these cell suspensions was transferred to separate chambers of 8-chambered cover glass and mixed with additional 250 μl of DB with 3 mM caffeine. Cells were kept in the dark for 10 min and were then used for imaging with confocal and TIRF microscopy. During each imaging session, cells were stimulated by adding 50 μl of 1 mM cAMP to the chamber.
Confocal microscopy
Dual-excitation confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope with a 100 × 1.3 NA oil immersion objective at 512 × 512 pixel resolution. GFP was exited at 488 nm and emitted light was collected between 495–535 nm. mRFPmars was exited at 543 nm and emitted light collected at 580–640 nm. Both channels were detected simultaneously at 1 fps with 800 Hz scanner speed. Cortical fluorescence dynamics and cell motility were quantified from confocal images by Quimp plugin to the Fiji software.
TIRF microscopy
Dual-channel TIRF microscopy was performed using Nicon Eclipse Ti TIRF microscope with 100 × 1.45 NA objective equipped with an OptoSplit II image splitter (Cairn Optics). GFP was exited at 488 and emitted light detected at 500–530 nm. mRFPmars was exited at 594 nm and fluorescence was detected at 600–680 nm. Both channels were detected simultaneously by a Photometrics CascadeII EMCCD camera at 1,024 × 1,024 pixels resolution with exposure times between 100 and 300 ms at 2 fps. Co-localization between two channels was quantified using Coloc2 plugin to the Fiji software.
