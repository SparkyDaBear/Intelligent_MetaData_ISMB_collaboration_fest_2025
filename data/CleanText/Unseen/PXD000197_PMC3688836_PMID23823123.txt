ABSTRACT:
AKT2 is one of the three isoforms of the protein kinase AKT being involved in the modulation of cellular metabolism. Since protein-protein interactions are one possibility to convey specificity in signal transduction, we performed AKT2-protein interaction analysis to elucidate their relevance for AKT2-dependent cellular functions. We identified heat shock protein 90 kDa (HSP90), Cdc37, heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP70), 78 kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78), tubulin, GAPDH, α-enolase and elongation factor 2 (EF2) as AKT2-interacting proteins by a combination of tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry in HEK293T cells. Quantitative MS-analysis using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) revealed that only HSP90 and Cdc37 interact stably with AKT2, whereas the other proteins interact with low affinity with AKT2. The interactions of AKT2 with α-enolase and EF2 were further analyzed in order to uncover the functional relevance of these newly discovered binding partners. Despite the interaction of AKT2 and α-enolase, which was additionally validated by proximity ligation assay (PLA), no significant impact of AKT on α-enolase activity was detected in activity measurements. AKT stimulation via insulin and/or inhibition with the ATP-competitive inhibitor CCT128930 did not alter enzymatic activity of α-enolase. Interestingly, the direct interaction of AKT2 and EF2 was found to be dynamically regulated in embryonic rat cardiomyocytes. Treatment with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 before stimulation with several hormones stabilized the complex, whereas stimulation alone led to complex dissociation which was analyzed in situ with PLA. Taken together, these findings point to new aspects of AKT2-mediated signal transduction in protein synthesis and glucose metabolism.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All procedures concerning animal handling were in accordance with the German Protection of Animals Act, executed by the local Animal Care and Use Committee and registered under permission number O/29/2011. The rats used in this study were kept at the Tierversuchsanlage Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf, Germany. They were fed a standard chow diet and received water ad libitum. Rats were anesthetized with isofluran (2%) and killed by cervical dislocation.
Vectors
To perform TAP, the AKT2-protein was N- and C-terminally fused with a TAP-Tag, consisting of HA-Tag, StrepII-Tag and FLAG-Tag. For stable expression HEK293T cells were transfected using a lentiviral vector conferring puromycin resistance allowing selection of stably transfected cells (Fig. S1).
Cell Culture and Sample Preparation
HEK293T cells (ECACC/HPA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium DMEM (Invitrogen) under standard conditions. Cell lysis was performed with 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 0,1% NP 40, pH 7,4. Roche proteinase/phosphatase-inhibitor cocktail was added immediately before lysis. Lysates were clarified by 30 minutes centrifugation (4°C, 4000 rpm).
Cell Stimulation
HEK293T cells were treated with 25 µM LY294002 (Sigma) for one hour, 1 µg/ml IGF-1 (Milteny) or 1,75 µg/ml insulin (Sanofi Aventis) for 10 minutes. Embryonic E18 rat cardiac myocytes were serum deprived with 1% FBS supplemented medium and then treated with 50 µM LY294002 for one hour or with 100 nM angiotensin II (Sigma) for 30 minutes.
SILAC-labeling
Cells were labeled with 13C6 Lysine and 13C6 Arginine using the SILAC™ Protein ID & Quantitation Media Kit Lysine (DMEM-Flex) and SILAC™ Stable Isotopic [13C6]-L-Arginine (Invitrogen). Medium was prepared as described by the manufacturer. Cells were fed with SILAC medium over 5 passages to enable full incorporation of the labeled amino acids.
Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP)
Cell lysates were incubated for 1 h, 4°C, (400 rpm on a rotating platform) with Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation, beads were allowed to settle and the supernatant was removed. The resuspended beads were transferred to a Micro Bio-Spin column (BioRad). Beads were washed with 10 column volumes TBS (150 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7,4). Elution of the proteins was performed with 1 ml triple-FLAG peptide (N-Met-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-His-Asp-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-His-Asp-Ile-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-C) (300 µg/ml in TBS). The FLAG eluate was then affinity purified on a Strep-Tactin Sepharose (IBA Technologies) column. Beads were washed with 10 column volumes Strep buffer (100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8,0). Tagged proteins were eluted with 2,5 mM Biotin (Sigma-Aldrich) in Strep buffer. The Strep-eluate was concentrated with Centrifugal Filter Units, 10K Membrane (Millipore).
Silver Staining and Image Analysis
MS compatible silver staining was performed according to Shevchenko et al. with minor modifications as described before.
Tryptic Digestion
In gel digestion was performed as described. To digest TAP purified proteins in solution 8 M urea was added to the concentrated sample. Proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 h at 30°C and then alkylated with 40 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at 30°C. Afterwards the solution was diluted 1∶10 in 50 mM NH4HCO3, 5 mM Ca2Cl, concentrated over Centrifugal Filter Units (10K Membrane, Millipore) and digested with trypsin for 16 h at 37°C.
Nano-LC-MS/MS Analysis
Proteolytic digests were analyzed with an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) after separation by nano-LC as described earlier. To conduct peptide analysis after in solution digest peptide mixtures were subjected to automated off-line 2-D LC-MS/MS using the microfraction collection option of the WPS 3000PL autosampler. Peptides were separated on a 1 mm×15 cm Polysulfoethyl-Aspartamide column (Dionex, Thermo Scientific) in the first dimension by gradient elution from 0–60% B for 30 min, 60–100% B for 5 min (A: 5 mM NaH2PO4, pH 2.7; B: 5 mM NaH2PO4, 15% acetonitrile, 500 mM NaCl, pH 2.7) at a flow rate of 50 µl/min. One minute fractions collected by the autosampler were re-injected for reverse-phase nano-LC-MS/MS. Each MS full scan (m/z 350–2000, acquired at a target value of 1,000,000 ions with resolution r = 60,000 at m/z 400) was followed by MS/MS scans of the ten most intense ions, whereby the normalized collision energy for collision induced dissociation was set at 35 units, and a repeat count of 1 with a 20 sec exclusion duration window was applied (exclusion mass width of 10 ppm). Multistage activation was enabled upon detection of a neutral loss of phosphoric acid for further fragmentation.
Sequence Database Searching, Protein Identification and Relative Quantification
Sequence database-search of the MS data was performed against the uniprot human taxonomy-9606 database containing 83659 entries using the SEQUEST algorithm with the following parameters: trypsin specificity, two missed cleavage sites, precurser ion mass accuracy tolerance of 10–30 ppm, cysteine carbamidomethylation, methionine oxidation, pSTY, N-terminal protein acetylation and, when performed, SILAC labels Lys-6, Arg-6 specified as modifications. The minimal cross-correlation score (XCorr) was set to 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 for charge states +2, +3 and +4 respectively. The ΔCN had to be >0.1 and the minimal peptide probability allowed was 0.05. The minimum number of peptides necessary for protein identification was three. Relative quantification of peptides/proteins was carried out with the PepQuan feature of the Bioworks Browser 3.3.1 SP1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peak areas were calculated with a mass tolerance of 0.1, a minimum threshold of 15000 and no smoothing. When necessary, peak integration was manually corrected. Each protein ratio was calculated as mean value from a minimum of three unique peptide ratios. If a peptide ratio could not be calculated due to the absence of the corresponding peptide in the control sample, the ratio was set as ∞. Accordingly, the corresponding protein ratio was also ∞.

Proximity Ligation Assay
Cells were plated on adhesive microscope slides with silane treated surfaces (Marienfeld) in 20 mm2 areas, marked with a liquid-repellent slide marker pen (Daido Sangyo Co., Ltd.). Areas were covered with 0,1% gelatine before cell plating. Cells were allowed to settle down for 4 h or overnight, washed in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2,7 mM KCl, 8,1 mM Na2HPO4× 2H2O, 1,76 mM KH2PO4, pH 7,4), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0,1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7,4 and permeabilized with 0,2% saponin in PBS. Primary antibodies were used in appropriate concentration (1∶100–1∶500) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Afterwards the PLA-protocol was performed with Duolink InSitu reagents (Olink Bioscience) as described before. Slides were mounted with Duolink InSitu Mounting Medium with DAPI. Primary Antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, abcam): AKT2 Mouse mAB (5239), eEF2-Antibody (2332), GAPDH Rabbit mAB (2118), AKT1 Mouse mAB (2967), anti-ENO1-antibody (ab85086). Slides were examined under the fluorescence microscope Keyence BZ 9000 (Keyence) using a 60× objective. To evaluate protein interactions, five to ten image sections were analyzed for the ratio of signals per nuclei. The diagrams show relative numbers of signals per nuclei. The PLA-samples were set to 100%. The signals/nuclei of the corresponding controls are shown as percentage of full PLA for each experiment.
ENO1 Activity Assay
To measure activity of α-enolase, the ENO1 Human Activity Assay Kit (Abcam, ab117994) was used. α-enolase was purified from cell lysates by immuno-affinity purification and then incubated with a solution which contained the substrate of α-enolase, 2-phosphoglycerate, which was converted to phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP). PEP was then further processed by pyruvate kinase to pyruvate which is used by lactate dehydrogenase to form lactate under NADH-consumption. The decrease of NADH-concentration was measured as change in NADH-absorbance at 340 nm. HEK293T wild type cells were stimulated with insulin (1,75 µg/ml) for 10 minutes or treated with 10 µM CCT128930 (AKT-inhibitor) (SelleckBio.com) for 30 minutes. Sample preparation and assay procedure was performed as described by the manufacturer using a protein concentration of 10 µg/ml. NADH-absorbance was measured at 25°C with a Fluostar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech) at 340 nm.
Preparation of Embryonic Rat Cardiomyocytes (E18)
Adult pregnant Wistar rats were anesthetized with isofluran (2%) and killed by cervical dislocation. Embryos were decapitated before preparing the hearts. All procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the local Animal Care and Use Committee. Cardiomyocytes were isolated by enzymatic dissociation with collagenase Type II (Gibco, 1 mg/ml) and trypsin (Gibco, 3 mg/ml) in dissociation buffer and plated at a density of 5×105 cells/well and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). For further information see online supplement (Protocol S1). On the next day cells were treated with mitomycin (Sigma, 10 µg/ml) for 1 hour to prevent further proliferation of fibroblasts.
