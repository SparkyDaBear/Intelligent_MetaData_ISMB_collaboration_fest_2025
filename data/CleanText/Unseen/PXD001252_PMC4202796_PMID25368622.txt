ABSTRACT:
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) target a variety of protein substrates to regulate cellular signaling processes in eukaryotes. In plants, the number of identified MAPK substrates that control plant defense responses is still limited. Here, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants with an inducible system to simulate in vivo activation of two stress-activated MAPKs, MPK3, and MPK6. Metabolome analysis revealed that this artificial MPK3/6 activation (without any exposure to pathogens or other stresses) is sufficient to drive the production of major defense-related metabolites, including various camalexin, indole glucosinolate and agmatine derivatives. An accompanying (phospho)proteome analysis led to detection of hundreds of potential phosphoproteins downstream of MPK3/6 activation. Besides known MAPK substrates, many candidates on this list possess typical MAPK-targeted phosphosites and in many cases, the corresponding phosphopeptides were detected by mass spectrometry. Notably, several of these putative phosphoproteins have been reported to be associated with the biosynthesis of antimicrobial defense substances (e.g., WRKY transcription factors and proteins encoded by the genes from the “PEN” pathway required for penetration resistance to filamentous pathogens). Thus, this work provides an inventory of candidate phosphoproteins, including putative direct MAPK substrates, for future analysis of MAPK-mediated defense control.

Materials and methods
Plant material and growth
Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) was transformed with a constitutively-active variant of MKK5 (designated as MKK5DD or DD) from Petroselinum crispum (Lee et al.,), under the control of a dexamethasone(DEX)-inducible promoter (Aoyama and Chua,). As a control, the Col-0 genotype was additionally transformed with a kinase-inactive MKK5 mutant (designated as MKK5KR or KR). These two transgenic lines are hereafter abbreviated as Col-0 DD or Col-0 KR, respectively. For the MKK5DD construct, transformation was also performed with the MAPK mutants, mpk3 (Miles et al.,) and mpk6-3 (Wang et al.,), the ethylene-insensitive mutants, ethylene-insensitive2 (ein2-1) and ethylene-insensitive3 (ein3-1)/ein3-like 1 (eil1-1) double mutant (An et al.,), as well as the NADPH oxidase mutant (respiratory burst oxidase homologD, rbohD) (Torres et al.,). After selection for hygromycin resistance, putative transformants were validated for DEX-inducible expression of the myc-tagged MKK5 protein by western blot analysis. This resulted in the following independent transformants: 4 Col-0 KR, 14 Col-0 DD, 2 mpk3 DD, 4 ein2 DD and only one transgenic line for mpk6 DD, rbohD DD or ein3/eil1 DD. Stability of transgene expression was monitored by western blotting in the F2 generation and segregation of the DEX-inducible cell death phenotype (for the MKK5DD transgenic lines) was tested in the F3 generation. After these initial characterizations, a representative line—with comparable DEX-inducible expression level of the MKK5 protein—was selected for each genotype for subsequent analysis.
Seeds were sown on soil, stratified for 2 days at 4°C, and after transfer to individual pots, the plants were eventually maintained under short-day conditions (8 h day light, 200 μE, 23°C) for 6 weeks prior to DEX treatment (20 μM DEX in 0.0075% SILWET L-77). Three biological replicates were collected with each sample (genotype or timepoint) consisting of pooled leaf material from six different plants.
Western blot
Protein extraction and immunoblot with anti-pTEpY (α-phospho-p44/42-ERK; CST, www.cellsignal.com) to detect activated forms of the MAPKs or c-myc epitope to detect the MKK5 proteins were performed as described (Ranf et al.,).
Proteomics analysis
Protein extraction and phosphoprotein enrichment
Details to total protein and phosphoprotein enrichment via the Prefractionation-assisted Phosphoprotein Enrichment (PAPE) procedure can be found in Lassowskat et al.. PAPE is a two-step fractionation with 40% ammonium sulfate precipitation that apparently enriches phosphoproteins (Lassowskat et al.,), followed by a metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) step (Wolschin and Weckwerth,). Typically, 25 g of frozen leaf material were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and extracted by vigorous shaking (20 min, 4°C) with three volumes (w/v) of extraction buffer (100 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) ß-mercaptoethanol, 1% (v/v) protease and phosphatase-inhibitor II and III mix from Sigma-Aldrich). After centrifugation (3220 × g, 4°C, 15 min) and filtering through a 0.45 micron Rotilabo® cellulose mixed ester (CME) filter (Roth, http://www.carlroth.com), the supernatant was either used for 40% ammonium sulfate precipitation (first step of PAPE as described; Lassowskat et al.,) or mixed with Tris-EDTA-buffered phenol (for the total protein fraction). The lower organic phase after centrifugation (3220 × g, 4°C, 15 min) was re-extracted (with an equal volume of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.4, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.4% ß-mercaptoethanol). Proteins in the phenol phase were precipitated overnight (−20°C) with five volumes of cold precipitation solution (methanol containing 100 mM ammonium acetate). The protein pellet (3220 × g, 4°C, 15 min) was rinsed with precipitation solution and twice with a cold mixture (−20°C) of 80% (v/v) acetone/20% Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After 5 min drying, the pellet was resuspended in shotgun buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 8 M urea) to obtain the total protein extract.
For the second step in the PAPE procedure, strict adherence to the protein:metal matrix ratio is essential for the MOAC step. Typically, a 1.5 ml protein sample (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with 40 mg of Al(OH3) (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been washed and equilibrated in MOAC incubation buffer. After 30 min (4°C) rotation, the metal oxide was precipitated (18514 × g, 2 min) and rinsed four times with incubation buffer. The proteins were eluted twice (800 and 400 μl) with tetrapotassium pyrophosphate (TKPP) buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM TKPP, pH 9.0) for 45 min at room temperature. The pooled eluates were centrifuged twice (18514 × g, 2 min, 15°C), to pellet any remaining matrix, and concentrated with centricon filter devices (3 kDa cut-off; Millipore, http://www.merckmillipore.com). Proteins were precipitated with a 2D-CleanUp kit (GE Healthcare, http://www.gelifesciences.com), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and solubilized in shotgun buffer.
In-solution digestion
Protein concentration was determined by 2-D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare, www.gelifesciences.com) and the proteins were reduced (100 mM DTT, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, for 1 h) and alkylated (200 mM iodoacetamide, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, for 1 h). The solution was diluted to an end concentration of 0.5 M urea with 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8) and digested overnight with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, www.promega.com) at a ratio of 1:50 at 37°C. Peptides (max. 200 μL) were desalted on C18 columns (for up to 30 μg peptide samples, PepClean™, Thermo Scientific, www.piercenet.com; or for up to 1 mg peptide samples, C18 Protea Spin Tips, Protea Biosciences, https://proteabio.com/) according to the supplier's instructions and reconstituted in 5% ACN, 0.1% TFA.
Mass spectrometry (proteomics)
Tryptic digests were analyzed with an LC-MS system consisting of a nano-LC (Easy-nLC II, Thermo Scientific, www.proxeon.com) coupled to a hybrid-FT-mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro, Thermo Scientific, www.thermoscientific.com). Peptide separations were performed on a C18 column (EASY column; 10 cm, ID 75 μm, particle diameter 3 μm) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min and a linear gradient of 5–40% B in 150 min for total protein measurements and 300 min for measurement of the phosphoprotein-enriched fractions (A: 0.1% formic acid in water, B: 0.1% formic acid in ACN). A voltage of +1.9 kV was applied to electrospray peptide ions. A capillary temperature of 275°C for peptide transfer and a lock mass of 445.120024 m/z were used. Precursor mass scanning was performed from 400 to 1850 m/z in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 30,000 and the 20 most intense precursor ions were selected for subsequent CID fragmentation in the linear trap quadrupole mass analyzer (LTQ). Singly charged ions were rejected from fragmentation. Dynamic exclusion was enabled (Repeat Count: 1, Repeat Duration: 20 s, Exclusion List Size: 500, Exclusion Duration: 30 s).
Spectral data analysis
Each sample (genotypes/treatments (i.e., transgene)/timepoints) is based on three biological replicates, which are each measured twice (resulting in six values per sample). The resulting MS raw data were analyzed with the Progenesis LC-MS software (Nonlinear Dynamics Limited, www.nonlinear.com). After alignment and feature detection, normalization was applied automatically to all features as recommended by the Progenesis LC-MS software manual. Resulting features were filtered for an ANOVA p-value of <0.05 and fold-change of >2.0 (between the MKK5DD and MKK5KR plants). Available MS spectra with rank 10 and better were searched against an A. thaliana protein database based on TAIR10 (www.arabidopsis.org) using an in-house Mascot server (with the following parameters: precursor mass tolerance: 7 ppm, fragment mass tolerance: 0.8 Da, missed cleavages: 2). Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a static modification. Variable modifications were oxidation (M), acetylation of protein N-terminus, deamidation (NQ), and phosphorylation (STY). Peptides with Mascot scores less than 20 were rejected. Protein grouping and quantitation from non-conflicting peptides was enabled. Normalized abundance relative to maximum (Tables S04–S09) was calculated based on normalized abundance from Progenesis LC-MS. Maximum value of each protein (from 0 to 24 h samples) was set as one, with all other values being relative to this. Phosphopeptides were identified with the Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software, which includes the phosphoRS 2.0 algorithm (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for phospho-site mapping. A false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated by searching a “decoy” database containing all the target database sequences in reverse order. Peptide-spectrum match (PSM) was set at a q < 0.05 (i.e., a corrected significance threshold employing the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR procedure to control for a family-wise error rate).
Targeted proteomics analysis
The LC method with 300 min gradient as well as the MS acquisition method was identical to point Mass spectrometry (proteomics) with the following changes. A global parent mass list was used (Table S20) and dynamic exclusion was disabled. Parent masses were extracted from previous measurements of phosphopeptides. Spectral data analysis was performed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 according to parameters described in point Spectral data analysis. The number of PSMs was calculated as a sum from measurements of the four samples (collected 4, 5, 7, 8 h after DEX treatment).
Metabolomics analysis
Metabolite extraction
Frozen leaf material was homogenized in liquid nitrogen and weighed (50 ± 2 mg) into a pre-cooled 2-ml polypropylene tube. After addition of 80% methanol (200 μL), pre-cooled at −80°C and spiked with indole-3-acetyl-L-valine (1 μM), o-anisic acid (1 μM), and kinetin (2 μM) as internal standards the sample was allowed to reach room temperature under vigorous shaking within 5 min. The resulting mixture was sonicated (10 min, 20°C) and centrifuged at 11,200 ×g (10 min, 16°C). The sediment was re-extracted with 80% methanol (200 μL). Both supernatants were combined and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at 40°C using a vacuum centrifuge. The remaining residue was thoroughly reconstituted in 30% methanol (150 μL), sonicated (15 min, 20°C) and centrifuged at 11,200 × g (10 min, 16°C). An 80-μl aliquot of the supernatant was transferred into an autosampler vial and subjected to LC/MS analysis in both positive and negative ion mode. For quantification of abundant metabolites a 30-μl aliquot of the supernatant was diluted with 120 μl methanol/water, 3/7 (v/v) and subjected to LC-MS analysis in negative ion mode.
Mass spectrometry (metabolomics)
Leaf extracts were analyzed with a LC-MS system consisting of an UPLC (Acquity, Waters, www.waters.com) coupled to a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (micrOTOF-Q I, Bruker Daltonics, www.bruker.com) equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source. Chromatographic separations were performed at 40°C on a HSS T3 column (100 × 1.0 mm, particle size 1.8 μm, Waters) applying the following binary gradient at a flow rate of 150 μL min−1: 0–1 min, isocratic 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water), 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile); 1–10 min, linear from 5 to 60% B; 10–12 min, isocratic 95% B; 12–14 min, isocratic 5% B. The injection volume was 2.6 μL (full loop injection). Eluted compounds were detected from m/z 100–1000 in positive (negative) ion mode using the following instrument settings: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 1.6 bar; dry gas, nitrogen, 6 l/min, 190°C; capillary, −5000 V (+4000 V); end plate offset, −500 V; funnel 1 RF, 200 Vpp; funnel 2 RF, 200 Vpp; in-source CID energy, 0 V; hexapole RF, 100 Vpp; quadrupole ion energy, 3 eV; collision gas, argon; collision energy, 3 eV (10 eV); collision RF 200/400 Vpp (timing 50/50); transfer time, 70 μs; pre pulse storage, 5 μs; pulser frequency, 10 kHz; spectra rate, 3 Hz. Mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode. Calibration of the m/z scale was performed for individual raw data files on lithium formate cluster ions obtained by automatic infusion of 20 μl 10 mM lithium hydroxide in isopropanol/water/formic acid, 49.9/49.9/0.2 (v/v/v) at a gradient time of 12 min using a diverter valve. For aquisition of collision-induced dissociation mass spectra appropriate precursor ions were selected using an isolation width of ± 4 m/z and fragmented inside the collision cell applying collision energies in the range of 10–40 eV. Product ions were detected using the same parameter settings as described above, except for spectra rate (1.5 Hz) and collision RF [100/200 Vpp (timing 50/50)].
Non-targeted data analysis and metabolite annotation
A total of 48 undiluted methanolic leaf extracts [genotype × treatment time × replicate = (Col-0 DD, Col-0 KR) × (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36 h) × 3] were analyzed by UPLC/ESI-QTOFMS in positive and negative ion mode resulting in a total of 96 raw data files. To judge analytical quality and estimate alignment parameters retention times and responses of spiked internal standards were determined in prior to non-targeted data analysis (retention time deviation ≈ ±2.5 s, coefficient of variation of internal standard responses ≤11%). Raw data files were converted into mzData format using CompassXPort (Bruker Daltonics) and processed for each ion mode in two batches of 48 raw data files using the R package XCMS (Smith et al.,). Raw data files were arranged in 16 sample classes according to genotype and treatment time. Feature detection was performed using the centWave algorithm [sntresh = 3, prefilter = (3, 100), ppm = 25, peak width = (5, 12)]. Alignment was accomplished by consecutively applying the XCMS functions group.density (minfrac = 1, bw = 2 and mzwid = 0.05), retcor (span = 1, missing = 0, extra = 0), and group.density (minfrac = 1, bw = 1 and mzwid = 0.03). Missing feature intensities were filled in using the XCMS function fillPeaks. The resulting intensity matrix (feature × sample) was log2-transformed and subjected to Two-Way ANOVA. Features with a significant genotype-treatment time interaction (p < 0.01) were filtered by intensity (maximum intensity ≥ 214 counts). The resulting feature sets (positive and negative ion mode) were used for reconstruction and annotation of the underlying compound mass spectra which was aided by the R package CAMERA (Kuhl et al.,) and manual analyses using DataAnalysis 4.0 (Bruker Daltonics). High-resolution CID mass spectra of annotated quasi-molecular ions were acquired. Elemental compositions were calculated on accurate m/z of quasi-molecular ions within an error range of 10 ppm and filtered by relative isotope abundance, number of double bond equivalents and electron parity using the SmartFormula algorithm implemented in DataAnalysis 4.0. Putative elemental compositions were further checked for consistency by analysis of elemental compositions of fragment ions. Compounds were then putatively annotated by interpretation of characteristic fragment ions and neutral losses. Annotation of a total of 23 metabolites could be verified by analysis of reference compounds. Analytical data and mass spectral characterization is given in Tables S1, S2. Finally, all annotated compounds were manually quantified by integration of extracted ion chromatograms using QuantAnalysis 2.0 (Bruker Daltonics) and retention times/quantifier ions from Table S19.
