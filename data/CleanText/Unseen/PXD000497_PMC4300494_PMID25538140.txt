ABSTRACT:
Treatment of BRAF mutant melanomas with specific BRAF inhibitors leads to tumor remission. However, most patients eventually relapse due to drug resistance. Therefore, we designed an integrated strategy using (phospho)proteomic and functional genomic platforms to identify drug targets whose inhibition sensitizes melanoma cells to BRAF inhibition. We found many proteins to be induced upon PLX4720 (BRAF inhibitor) treatment that are known to be involved in BRAF inhibitor resistance, including FOXD3 and ErbB3. Several proteins were down-regulated, including Rnd3, a negative regulator of ROCK1 kinase. For our genomic approach, we performed two parallel shRNA screens using a kinome library to identify genes whose inhibition sensitizes to BRAF or ERK inhibitor treatment. By integrating our functional genomic and (phospho)proteomic data, we identified ROCK1 as a potential drug target for BRAF mutant melanoma. ROCK1 silencing increased melanoma cell elimination when combined with BRAF or ERK inhibitor treatment. Translating this to a preclinical setting, a ROCK inhibitor showed augmented melanoma cell death upon BRAF or ERK inhibition in vitro. These data merit exploration of ROCK1 as a target in combination with current BRAF mutant melanoma therapies.
METHODS:
Materials and Methods
Constructs and inhibitors
The shRNA kinome library contains hairpins targeting around 500 kinases. This library was assembled from The RNAi Consortium (TRC) human genomewide shRNA collection (TRC-Hs1.0) (OpenBiosystems) in four different pools, each containing around 1,000 hairpins. pLKO-SCR, pLKO-shROCK1 #094 (ATTTACCTCTTGTTCTAACCG), #096 (TATGTCCAATACCATAGATGG) and #159 (TACTTTGTGTTCATTTACCTC) were from the TRC-Hs1.0 library (OpenBiosystems). Inhibitors used were PLX4720 (Selleck), SCH772984 (Merck, via a MTA), GSK269962A (Axon Medchem) and metabolic poison phenyl arsine oxide (PAO) (Sigma).
Cell culture and viral transductions
BRAFV600E melanoma cells 04.01, 04.07, 93.03 and 00.08 were from Leiden University Medical Center, and the cell line identity was verified with STR profiling (PowerPlex 16 HS, Promega). These melanoma cells, mel888, A375 and HEK293T, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 9% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and penicillin + streptomycin. For lentiviral transductions, HEK293T was transfected with 8 μg plasmid in medium containing 25 mM chloroquine, using the helper plasmids pMDLglpRRE, pHCMV-G and pRSVrev, and refreshed after 6 and 24 h. After 48 h, virus supernatant was harvested and diluted for transduction. 04.01 melanoma cells were transduced with pLKO-sh-SCR or pLKO-sh-ROCK1 in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene and selected with 1.0 μg/ml puromycin. Four days after transduction, cells were set up for further experiments.
Kinome shRNA screen
04.01 melanoma cells were transduced with the four different pools of the shRNA kinome library at an MOI of 0.5. The next day, 1.0 μg/ml puromycin was added to the cells. Following 3 days of puromycin selection, cells were divided into three groups: a reference control, a DMSO-treated sample and a sample treated with the IC20 concentration of either PLX4720 (0.15 μM, for the PLX4720 screen) or SCH772984 (0.015 μM, for the ERKi screen). Cells were harvested after 4 and 7 days of treatment with the respective inhibitors. Genomic DNA was isolated, and shRNAs were amplified by PCR using a FOR primer incorporating the Illumina sequencing primer and a 6-bp index to allow discrimination of different samples (5′-ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTINDEXCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACCGG-3′), and a REV primer incorporating a P7 arm (5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATTTCTTTCCCCTGCACTGTACCC-3′). A second round of PCR was then performed using a FOR primer incorporating a P5 arm (5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3′) and the P7 REV primer. The PCR products were purified and analyzed by next-generation sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2000). The screens were performed independently three times, and results were analyzed with DESeq version 1.4.1 from R/Bioconductor (Gentleman et al,; Anders & Huber,). Hairpins were selected by comparing treated samples to DMSO-treated samples at day 7 (fold change 0.66, P < 0.05) and treated samples to DMSO-treated samples at day four (fold change < 1). Finally, hairpins from the two different screens (the PLX4720 and ERKi screen) were compared, and genes that were targeted by at least two hairpins in both screens were identified as hits for further analysis.
Dose response curves, drug treatments and mass spectrometry analysis
Equal cell numbers were plated on 96 wells, and the next day, cells were treated with different concentrations of indicated inhibitor(s). After 3 days, cell viability was determined with a cell titer blue assay (Promega), and fluorescence was quantified by a TECAN Infinite M200 scanner. Values were normalized to a negative control (no treatment, set at 100%) and a positive control for killing (PAO, set at 0%). For (phospho)proteomic analysis, 04.01 cells were plated on 10-cm plate, and the next day, cells were treated with vehicle or 0.5 μM PLX4720. Cells were harvested the same day (control vehicle treated cells), after 24 h and after 3 days. Cells in the supernatant were not included in the analysis. For drug treatments for Western blot analysis, 04.01 melanoma cells expressing sh-SCR or sh-ROCK1 were treated with 0.15 μM PLX4720 for 3 days. Cells in the supernatant were included in the Western blot analysis.
Western blot analysis
Samples were lysed in RIPA (50 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 2 mM orthovanadate). Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot analysis was performed using standard techniques on 4–12% bis-tris precast gels (NuPAGE). Proteins were transferred on nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). Primary antibodies were ROCK1(BD Transduction Laboratories), β-actin (AC74, Sigma), cleaved caspase 3 (Asp175), caveolin 1, phopho-MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204), MAPK, phopho-MEK (41G9), MEK (L38C12), phospho-p90RSK (Thr359/Ser363), RSK (against RSK1, 2, and 3) phospho-RPS6 (Ser235/236), RPS6 (all Cell Signaling), integrin β1 (Bio-Connect) and NRAS (F155, Santa Cruz). Protein detection was performed using ECL agent (Amersham), and developed films were scanned on an Epson Perfection 4990 Photo scanner.
Sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis
The cellular pellets of control sample and cells exposed to 1 and 3 days of PLX4720 treatment were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer [8 M Urea in 50 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 tablet of Complete mini EDTA-free mixture (Roche Applied Science) and one tablet of PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixture per 10 ml of lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science)]. Cells were then lysed by 10 rapid passages through a 23-gauge hypodermic syringe needle and by sonication on ice. After centrifugation (20,000 × g 30 min at 4°C), the protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Pierce). Proteins were reduced with 2 mM DTT at 56°C for 25 min, alkylated with 4 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min in the dark and reduced again with 2 mM DTT at room temperature to prevent over-alkylation. A first enzymatic digestion step was performed in 8 M urea lysis buffer using Lys-C at 37°C for 4 h (enzyme/substrate ratio 1:50). The sample was diluted four times with 50 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5 and digested overnight at 37°C with Trypsin (enzyme/substrate ratio 1:50). Finally, the digestion was quenched with 5% formic acid. The resulting peptides were chemically labeled using stable isotope dimethyl labeling as described before (Boersema et al,). The protein digests from the control sample, 1 day and 3 days of PLX4720 treatment were labeled as “Light” (L), “Medium” (M) and “Heavy” (H), respectively. An aliquot of each label was measured on a regular LC-MS/MS run, and samples were mixed 1:1:1 (L:M:H) based on their peptide intensities and dried down. The procedure was repeated in three biological replicates.
Protein expression levels analysis
The labeled peptides were reconstituted in 10% formic acid prior to fractionation using strong cation exchange (SCX) as described previously (Helbig et al,) for the protein expression levels analysis. The SCX system consisted of an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) with two C18 Opti-Lynx (Optimized Technologies, OR) trapping cartridges and a polysulfoethyl A SCX column (PolyLC, Columbia, MD; 200 mm × 2.1 mm inner diameter, 5 μm, 200-A). The peptides were dissolved in 10% FA and loaded onto the trap columns at 100 μl/min and subsequently eluted onto the SCX column with 80% acetonitrile (ACN; Biosolve, the Netherlands) and 0.05% FA. SCX buffer A was made of 5 mM KH2PO4 (Merck, Germany), 30% ACN and 0.05% FA, pH 2.7; SCX buffer B consisted of 350 mM KCl (Merck, Germany), 5 mM KH2PO4, 30% ACN and 0.05% FA, pH 2.7. The gradient was performed as follows: 0% B for 10 min, 0–85% B in 35 min, 85–100% B in 6 min and 100% B for 4 min. After injection of 200 μg of labeled lysate, a total of 45 fractions were collected, dried in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at −80°C.
Phosphoproteome analysis
The labeled peptides were reconstituted in 10% formic acid prior to fractionation using SCX as described previously (Hennrich et al,). The experiments were performed on an Agilent 1100/1200 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Germany). Peptides corresponding to 3 mg of tryptic digested lysate were loaded onto a C18 trap column (strata-x 33 μm Polymeric Reversed phase, 50 × 4.6 mm, Phenomenex, The Netherlands) for 5 min at 300 μl/min using aqueous 0.05% FA as solvent. Subsequently, peptides were eluted for 5 min from the trapping column with 80% ACN containing 0.05% FA onto a polysulfoethyl A column 200 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm particles and 200 Å pore size (PolyLC Inc., Columbia, MD) at the same flow rate. Separation was performed using a nonlinear 65 min gradient: isocratic for 2 min at 100% solvent A (5 mM KH2PO4, 30% ACN and 0.05% FA, pH 2.7); from 2 to 10 min at 3% solvent B (5 mM KH2PO4, 30% ACN, 350 mM KCl and 0.05% FA at pH 2.7); from 10 to 40 min a gradient to 35% solvent B; and from 40 to 45 min to 100% solvent B. The column was subsequently washed for 10 min with solvent B and finally equilibrated with 100% solvent A. Fractions were collected in 1-min intervals for the first 40 min and for 3-min intervals in the last 15 min. The fractions were desalted using Sep-Pak Vac C18 cartridge (3 cc/200 mg, Waters), and the eluted peptides were dried down and stored at −80°C for phosphopeptide enrichment by Ti4+-IMAC.
Phosphopeptide enrichment
Ti4+-IMAC material was prepared and used essentially as previously described (Zhou et al,). The prepared Ti4+-IMAC beads were loaded onto GELoader tips (Eppendorf) using a C8 plug to approximately 1–2 cm length of material. The enrichment procedure for all SCX fractions was as follows: The Ti4+-IMAC material was pre-equilibrated two times with 50 μl of Ti4+-IMAC loading buffer (80% ACN, 6% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)). Next, each SCX fraction was resuspended in 50 μl of loading buffer and loaded onto the equilibrated GELoader tips. Then, the Ti4+-IMAC material was washed with 50 μl wash buffer A (50% ACN, 0.5% TFA, 200 mM NaCl) and subsequently with 50 μl wash buffer B (50% ACN, 0.1% TFA). Bound peptides were first eluted by 30 μl of 10% ammonia into 30 μl of 10% FA. Finally, the remainder of the peptides was eluted with 2 μl of 80% ACN, 2% FA. The collected eluate was further acidified by adding 3 μl of 100% FA and subsequently stored at −80°C for LC-MS/MS analysis.
LC/MS/MS analysis
The phosphopeptides and the 3+ SCX fractions of the whole proteome analysis were analyzed on LTQ-Orbitrap Velos or Elite Mass Spectrometer equipped with an electron transfer dissociation (ETD) source (Thermo Fisher, Germany) and connected to an Easy UHPLC system (both Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). The columns were made in-house from either Aqua™ C18 (5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, USA; 20 mm × 100 μm i.d.) for the trap column or Zorbax C18 (1.8 μm, Agilent; 38 cm × 50 μm i.d.) for the analytical column (Cristobal et al,). Mobile-phase buffers for nLC separation consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 100% ACN/0.1% formic acid (solvent B). The peptides were eluted during a 3-h gradient and directly sprayed into the mass spectrometer. The flow rate was set at 100 nl/min, and the LC gradient was as follows: 7–30% solvent B within 151 min, 30–100% solvent B within 3 min, 100% solvent B for 2 min and 7% solvent B for 23 min. Nano spray was achieved with an in-house pulled and gold-coated fused silica capillary (360 mm o.d.; 20 mm i.d.; 10 mm tip i.d.) and an applied voltage of 1.7 kV. The mass spectrometer was programmed in a data-dependent decision tree acquisition mode and was configured to perform a Fourier transform survey scan from 350 to 1,500 m/z (resolution 60,000) followed by higher collision energy dissociation (HCD; 32% normalized collision energy, resolution 15,000) or ETD fragmentation of the 20 most intense peaks depending on the charge state and m/z of the precursor as previously described (Frese et al,). Supplemental activation was enabled for ETD. The 2+ SCX fractions of the whole proteome analysis were analyzed on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer connected to an Easy UHPLC system (both Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). The mass spectrometer was programmed in the data-dependent acquisition mode and was configured to perform a Fourier transform survey scan from 350 to 1,500 m/z (resolution 35,000) followed by higher collision energy dissociation fragmentation of the 20 most intense peaks (25% normalized collision energy at a target value of 50,000 ions, resolution 17,500).
Data processing
Raw data were analyzed by MaxQuant (version 1.3.0.5) (Cox & Mann,). Andromeda (Cox et al,) was used to search the MS/MS data against the human UniProt database (20,247 entries, released 2012_02) complemented with a list of common contaminants and concatenated with the reversed version of all sequences. Trypsin/P was chosen as cleavage specificity allowing two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation (C) was set as a fixed modification, while oxidation (M) and phosphorylation of STY were used as variable modifications. For dimethyl labeling, DimethylLys0 and DimethylNter0 were set as light labels, DimethylLys4 and DimethylNter4 were set as medium labels, and DimethylLys8 and DimethylNter8 were set as heavy labels. Peptide identification was based on a search with a mass deviation of the precursor ion of up to 6 ppm, and the allowed fragment mass deviation was set to 0.05 Da for FTMS and 0.6 Da for ITMS. Data filtering was carried out using the following parameters: Peptide and protein FDRs were set to 1%, minimum peptide length was set to 6, and Andromeda minimum score was set to 60 [≅ Mascot score 20 (Cox et al,)]. The reverse and common contaminant hits were removed from MaxQuant output. Protein quantification was performed by using only unmodified peptides and oxidation (M); the re-quantify option was enabled. Only unique peptides with at least two ratio counts were used for protein quantification.
Data availability
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository (Vizcaino et al,) with the dataset identifier PXD000497. PX reviewer account: username: review83857; password: 4G97r7 g3.
Statistics
To filter for those proteins that show (or have) a consistent abundance level over three independent biological replicates (1 day/control and 3 days/control), we applied a one-sample t-test against 0 (no abundance change). Only those proteins that had a P-value < 0.05 were considered. A two-sample t-test was performed to assess protein ratio differences between the two groups (3 days/control versus 1 day/control) and used as a filter to extract those proteins or phosphopeptides that show significant abundance differences (P-value < 0.05). In addition to the statistical filters, only proteins and phosphopeptides with an arbitrary cutoff ratio ≥ 1.5 or ≤ −1.5 fold changes were considered. Furthermore, phosphopeptides were required to have a phosphosite location probability ≥ 0.75.
Reactome analysis
The significant entries at protein level (with a fold change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ −1.5) were analyzed by Cytoscape 2.8 (Smoot et al,) using Reactome (Haw et al,) and Cerebral as plugins (Barsky et al,). Predicted interactions were removed from the analysis. Protein location was retrieved from UniProt database, and in case a protein had multiple locations, one was arbitrarily chosen to insert in Cerebral (Supplementary Table S4).
Gene ontology enrichment analysis by BiNGO
BiNGO Cytoscape plugin was used to perform gene ontology (GO) slim enrichment analysis (Maere et al,). For the proteome analysis, the software was run using both target (significant regulated proteins with a fold change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ −1.5) and background list (the complete list of identified proteins and phosphoproteins), to calculate enrichment of biological processes across the target list. The same procedure was performed for the phosphoproteome. A hypergeometric test was performed to test for enrichment, and Benjamini & Hochberg false discovery rate correction was applied to correct for multiple testing. Enriched biological processes below the corrected P-value threshold of 0.05 were considered.
