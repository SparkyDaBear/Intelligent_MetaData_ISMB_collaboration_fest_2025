ABSTRACT:
SUMMARY
A surprising complexity of ubiquitin signaling has emerged with identification of different ubiquitin chain topologies. However, mechanisms of how the diverse ubiquitin codes control biological processes remain poorly understood. Here, we use quantitative whole proteome mass spectrometry to identify yeast proteins that are regulated by lysine 11 (K11)-linked ubiquitin chains. The entire Met4 pathway, which links cell proliferation with sulfur amino acid metabolism, was significantly affected by K11 chains and selected for mechanistic studies. Previously we demonstrated that a K48-linked ubiquitin chain represses the transcription factor Met4. Here we show that efficient Met4 activation requires a K11-linked topology. Mechanistically our results propose that the K48 chain binds to a topology-selective tandem ubiquitin binding region in Met4 and competes with binding of the basal transcription machinery to the same region. The change to K11 enriched chain architecture releases this competition and permits binding of the basal transcription complex to activate transcription.
In brief
Li et al. discovered that a chain topology change from K48 to K11 linkages on the transcription factor Met4 relives competition between the K48 chain and the basal transcription complex for binding to the Met4 tandem-UBD. These findings provided insight into the role of ubiquitin chain topologies in ubiquitin signaling.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Yeast strains and culture
The key resource table shows the yeast strains used in this study. SUB592 had all of its endogenous ubiquitin genes deleted and a synthetic ubiquitin gene expressed under the control of the CUP1 promoter in a 2μ plasmid. The wild type (WT, JMP024) was generated for the ubiquitin gene, and ubiquitin K11R mutant strain (JMP025) was generated for ubiquitin K11R mutant as described previously for SILAC quantitative analysis.
To examine ubiquitin linkages on Met4, we deleted endogenous Met4 from JMP024 and replaced it with a G418-resistant gene from pFA6a kanMX4. PX001 was generated from JMP024 (Figure S5A) by PCR-mediated homologous recombination with the plasmid pRS316–3HA–Met4 (a gift from Dr. Laurent Kuras). In the same way, PX002 was generated from JMP025 (Figure S5B).
In general, the yeast strains were grown at 30 °C i n YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose) to A600 = 1.0 before harvest unless indicated. The protocol for SILAC was described previously. Minimal SD medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose and supplemented with the appropriate amino acids) was used to analyze the expression of Met4 in yeast. The plates were then cultured at 30 °C and recorded as indicated. To estimate the number of yeast cells, we made the assumption that A600 = 1.0 equates to 10 million CFU mL−1.
METHOD DETAILS
Sample preparation and MS analysis
In order to achieve a higher coverage of the yeast proteome, JMP024 (WT) and JMP025 (K11R) strains were cultured in SILAC medium separately. Yeast cells were harvested at the early exponential phase and lysed in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube with denaturing lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM NH4HCO3, 5 mM iodoacetamide) and 0.5 mm glass beads (Biospec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA).
Proteins in TCL samples were separated into 34 (for forward experiments) or 35 gel bands (for reverse experiments) on the basis of MW by SDS–PAGE with Coomassie blue staining. Each band was in-gel digested with endoproteinase Lys-C overnight to generate short peptides. After digestion, the peptide mixture was suspended in an extraction buffer (5% FA, 45% ACN) and dried using a vacuum dryer (LABCONCO CentriVap, MO, USA).
Peptides were analyzed using an LC–MS/MS platform comprising a nanoACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). The peptide mixtures were loaded onto a 75 μm i.d. × 15 cm capillary column (Beijing SpectraPeaks, Beijing, China) packed with 3 μm C18 reverse-phase fused silica (Michrom Bioresources, Inc., Auburn, CA, USA) and eluted with a 60–140 min nonlinear gradient ramped from 8–40% of mobile phase B (phase B: 0.1% FA in ACN, phase A: 0.1% FA and 2% ACN in water) at a flow rate of 0.3 μL min−1. Eluting peptides were analyzed using the LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer. The MS1 precursor was analyzed with a mass range 350–1,800 at a resolution of 30,000 at m/z = 400. The automatic gain control (AGC) was set at 1 × 106 and the maximum injection time (MIT) was set at 150 ms. MS2 spectra were collected in data-dependent mode for the 20 most intense ions, which were subjected to fragmentation via collision induced dissociation (CID) with 35% normalized collision energy in the LTQ. For each scan, the AGC was set at 5,000 and the maximum injection time at 25 ms. The dynamic range was set at 30–60 s to suppress repeated fragmentation of the same peaks.
Proteomics database searching
All raw files were converted into mzXML using Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (version 4.5.2), and searched by the Sequest–Sorcerer algorithm (version 4.0.4 build, Sage-N Research, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) against the combined target-decoy protein FASTA file from the Saccharomyces genome database (version released in 2011.02, 6717 entries, SGD, http://www.yeastgenome.org) along with 112 common contaminants (ftp.thegpm.org/fasta/cRAP). The decoy components were constructed by pseudo-reversed sequences of all target proteins.
For identification, semi-digestion of Lys-C was allowed with a maximum of two missed cleavages. Precursor mass tolerance was 20 ppm. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine and the labeling of 13C6 of lysine were added as variable modifications and the labeling efficiency of heavy-labeled lysine reached up to 99% in the yeast. A minimal peptide length of seven amino acids was required. The search results were processed using an in-house software with FDR < 1% on peptide and protein level. As peptides are targets of the shotgun proteomics strategy, it is difficult to guarantee that the proteins with highly homologous amino acid sequences will be unambiguously identified by unique peptides to all of the proteins within such high homology groups. When matching filtered peptides to proteins, we assigned the proteins sharing the same peptide(s) in one group, in which the top protein with the highest number of peptide matches was selected to represent the group. If multiple proteins in the same group had the same sequence coverage, one of them was randomly selected as representative of the identification. Therefore, the other ones were assigned as missing proteins, even though these proteins had identified peptides. After that, the spectra generated from the proteins with only one identified peptide were manually checked to confirm the identification produced via automated processing of our MS data.
After identification, data from our SILAC label-swap experiments were analyzed through our in-house software as described previously. P-value was calculated for significantly changed proteins in WT and K11R (Figure 2A). Only proteins with P-value < 0.01 were considered as significantly changed proteins in the proteome. The other proteins were considered as unchanged proteins. The same rule was applied on the analysis of significantly changed transcripts.
For protein copy number quantification, the area under the extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) for fully digested peptides in label-swap samples was calculated using SILVER. The intensity of a peptide was first normalized by the median of all peptide intensities in the corresponding sample, then the geometric mean of the intensities from four samples was calculated as the final intensity for each peptide. The mean and standard deviation of the intensity of each unique peptide from each corresponding sample was calculated. The peptides with intensity beyond the mean by at least ± 2 standard deviations were removed as outliers. The sum of the remaining peptides was divided by the protein MW as the final intensity of each protein. With the help of high sequence coverage identification, the influence of the bias of peptide detectability by MS/MS on quantification can be corrected to some extent. The correlation of transcript abundance and protein intensity reached up to 0.65, indicating that the abundance of proteins is mainly affected by the levels of corresponding mRNAs.
Bioinformatics analysis of identified peptides and proteins
Protein information, including gene symbol, chromosome loci, gene model and modifications, was mainly extracted from SGD annotations. Part of the ubiquitination annotations came from the database UUCD 2.0 (http://uucd.biocuckoo.org). Four representative proteome datasets, namely tandem affinity purification (TAP), green fluorescent protein (GFP), PeptideAtlas and Mann 2008, were compared with our proteome dataset (Figures 1D and S1F). According to the SGD annotations, all proteins was classified into three catalogs including “Core”, “Hypothetical” and “Dubious”. “Core” proteins refer to verified ORFs or uncharacterized ORFs with essential function. “Hypothetical” proteins refer to putative or hypothetical uncharacterized ORFs. “Dubious” proteins refer to dubious ORFs. Among the 26 proteins annotated as the products of pseudogene, only four were present in our dataset (Figure S2D). Among the remaining 22 pseudogenes, only one was covered by the TAP dataset, and the other 21 were missed in all the published datasets (Figure S2E).
Mitosis annotations (Figure S3D) were extracted from database MiCroKiTS 3.0 (http://microkit.biocuckoo.org). A Venn diagram was drawn using the online tool jvenn (http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/jvenn/example.html).
Synthesized peptides for validation of pseudogenes
Peptides for validation of identified pseudogenes were synthesized by Shanghai Leon Chemical Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The peptides (0.1–1 pmol) were dissolved in a buffer containing 5% ACN and 1% FA and desalted with a homemade StageTip as described previously. The peptide samples were analyzed with LC–MS/MS as described above (Figure S2E).
RNA extraction, RNA-seq and data analysis
The same batches of yeast cultures (WT and K11R) as for proteomics analysis were used for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Poly(A) RNA was purified with the Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) from 10 μg of total RNA for each sample according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and then used to synthesize cDNA using random hexamer primers and DNA polymerase I. Double-stranded cDNA was end-repaired with T4 DNA polymerase, after which a single adenosine was added to the 3’ end of cDNA. Illumina adapters were ligated to the repaired cDNA ends, allowing for the subsequent hybridization to the flow cell surface. Fragments of 400–500 bp were separated from 2% agarose gel. Libraries were amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase (NEB, Beverly, MA, USA). All libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000. Each sample was sequenced to 5 M reads.
RNA sequencing reads were mapped to Saccharomyces Genome Database (version released in 2011.02, 6717 entries, SGD, http://www.yeastgenome.org/download-data). In each sample, genes with more than 5 mapped reads were deemed as high confident identifications. The RNA-seq data was processed using algorithms built into tophat and cufflinks. The number of fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per million base pairs sequenced (FPKM) was calculated to quantify each gene transcript. RNA-seq analysis achieved saturation and identified slightly more protein-coding genes than the MS-based proteome, which proved the high depth of our transcriptomic dataset.
Protein half-life analysis
Protein half-lives were performed mainly described as previously. The yeast JMP024 and JMP025 strains were heavily labelled in SC medium with 30 mg/L [13C6] L-lysine and 20 mg/L L-arginine [13C6/15N4] (Cambridge Isotope Labs, Tewksbury, MA, USA). After completely SILAC labeling, cells were washed with cold SC medium without lysine and arginine and diluted to optical density OD=0.3 (A600) in 200 mL SC medium containing light lysine and arginine. The cells were harvested at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes. Then the samples were lysed in denatured condition (8M urea, 50mM NH4HCO3 and digested in solution with Lys-C for 6 hr and then with trypsin overnight. The peptide sample was not fractionated and analyzed with LC-MS/MS with technical replication. The MS raw files were analyzed with MaxQuant (1.5.3.0) and at least two points were used to calculate decay rates as described. The coefficient of determination linear regressions (R2) were calculated and protein with R2≥0.9 were kept for half-life calculation.
Protein extraction and western blot assay
TCL samples were prepared under denaturing condition in a urea buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM Tris, 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide, pH 8.0). Cells were broken with glass beads for 5 × 20 s in a Bertin precellys™ 24 homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, France) with 1 min breaks on ice between runs. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 25 min at 100,000 g. Proteins in TCL samples were separated by a 10% SDS–PAGE.
For western blot, separated proteins were transferred to an NC membrane and probed with the monoclonal mouse Met4 antibody from Mike Tyers (University of Montreal)) (1:1000 dilution), followed by HPR-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution). The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer life Science, MA, USA).
To confirmed the specificity of anti-K11 polyubiquitin linkage-specific antibody, we took equal amount of K11-linked diubiquitin (UC40B, Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA, USA), K48-linked diubiquitin (UC200B, Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA, USA) and K63-linked diubiquitin (UC300B, Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA, USA) and loaded onto NC membrane as well, probed with the human anti-K11 polyubiquitin linkage-specific antibody (Clone 2A3/2E6, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA) (1:500 dilution), followed by HPR-conjugated anti-human secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution). The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer life Science, MA, USA).
Purification of 3 x HA tagged Met4
Yeast cells were broken by glass beads and total protein was extracted in a native Tris buffer (50 mM Tris, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide, pH 7.5) in a Bertin precellys™ 24 homogenizer as described previously. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 10 min. The monoclonal mouse HA antibody (HA.11; Covance, Dedham, MA, USA) was added to the cell extract. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 hr, and washed the beads four times with native Tris buffer after binding to protein G agarose (Life technologies, Rockford, IL, USA) for 2 h at 4 °C. T hen bound 3HA-tagged Met4 was eluted with SDS–PAGE loading buffer (80 °C, 5 min) containing 5 mM DTT to eliminate the link between the light- and heavy-chain in antibodies.
To remove the contaminants from the immunoprecipitated Met4 under native conditions, we performed TAP on Met4. Briefly, 3HA-tagged Met4 in yeast TCL samples was bound to the HA antibody and protein G agarose as mentioned previously. After washing four times with native Tris buffer, the beads were re-suspended by eluting buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.5), and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The supernatant containing enriched Met4 was transferred to a new tube. The solution was then diluted with 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 0.02% SDS. The Met4 was then reacted with the same monoclonal mouse HA antibody again at 4 °C for 2 h. The 3HA-tagged Met4–HA antibody complex was bound to protein G agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing by native tris buffer, the purified Met4 was eluted with SDS–PAGE loading buffer and then separated by SDS–PAGE, digested by trypsin and analyzed by LC–MS/MS. On the other hand, separated proteins were transferred to an NC membrane and probed with the human anti-K11 polyubiquitin linkage-specific antibody (Clone 2A3/2E6, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA) (1:500 dilution), followed by HPR-conjugated anti-human secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution). The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer life Science, MA, USA). After that, washed off all the antibody bound on the NC membrane with stripping buffer for 30min. then probed with monoclonal mouse HA antibody (HA.11; Covance, Dedham, MA, USA) (1:1000 dilution), followed by HPR-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution). The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer life Science, MA, USA) as well.
Targeted detection of polyUb linkages on Met4
To measure constitution and relative abundance of ubiquitin chains modified on HA–Met4, seven kinds of heavy-labeled GG-peptide (GG-remnant modified lysine peptides, standing for different ubiquitin linkage modification) were used as standards for precise identification and relative quantification. After TAP, the resulting peptide samples were dissolved in a sample buffer (1% FA, 1% ACN) and analyzed by LC–MS/MS platform mentioned above. Eluted peptides were detected by the LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer in a survey scan (300–1600 m/z, resolution 30,000) followed by selective reaction monitoring (SRM) scans for light- and heavy-labeled GG-peptides in the LTQ. The peptides for SRM are provided in the key resource table. The intensities of peptides were analyzed by ion chromatograms using Xcalibur v2.0 software (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA, USA). Three biological repeats were applied in this study.
Purification of truncated Met4 and Med15
The fragment of yeast Met4 (amino acids 76–160) was expressed from a modified pET28(a) vector with an N-terminal Avi-6xHis-SUMO tag. BL21 (DE3) cells were cotransformed with the Met4 expression construct and a pBirAcm plasmid coding for BirA for biotinylation of the Avi tag. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG in the presence of 5 ug/ml biotin at 16 °C overnight. Cell s were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM PMSF, 5 mM imidazole, and 0.1% triton X, pH8.0), sonicated on ice, and the lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C, 11,000 g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Qigen, Dusseldorf, Germany) for 1 hr at 4 °C with constant tumbling. The Ni-NTA resin was l oaded on to a column and washed with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole followed by elution with 4 times 500 μL of 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. Samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-NC Transfer Membrane (Millipore, MA, USA). Amido black staining was used to determine purification and Western blot, and streptavidin-HRP was used to detect biotin incorporation. Fractions containing biotinylated Met4 (amino acids 76–160) were combined and concentrated on an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter.
Yeast Med15 construct, pAL01(6xHis- Med15 1–651 Δ239–271, Δ373–483) in BL21 (DE3) RIL, was provided to us by Derek Pacheco as described. Cells were grown in YT media with ampicillin at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.8 and the temperature was reduced to 16 °C. T he protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG at 16 °C overnight. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.0), sonicated on ice, and the lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C 12000 rpm for 30 mins. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA resin (GE Healthcare, PA, USA) for 1 h at 4 °C with constant tumbling. The Ni-NTA resin was loaded on to a column and washed with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT followed by elution with 5 times 500 μL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT. Samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-NC Transfer Membrane (Millipore, MA, USA). Amido black staining was used to determine purification. Pure fractions were combined and concentrated on an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter.
Expression analyses using NanoString
For Nanostring analysis, RNA was isolated from frozen pellets with RNeasy™Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany) as per manufacturer’s protocol. 100 ng of RNA of three biological replicates were processed on a NanoString nCounter (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) with a costume code set (Table S5) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The code set contains 21 Met4 target genes as well as three housekeeping genes of different abundance for normalization. Detailed information about the code set can be obtained on request. The results were analyzed using nSolver (4.0 software).
Biolayer Interferometry
The binding affinity of tetra-ubiquitin chains (K11 and K48, Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA, USA) and mediator component Med15 to Met4(76–160) was determined by using ForteBio Octet RED96 (Pall ForteBio LLC, Fremont, CA, USA). All proteins were diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01 mg/mL BSA, and 0.02% tween 20, pH7.5) as follows: Met4(76–160) final concentration 20 μg/mL, the quenching solution (biocytin) was diluted to 5 μg/mL, and the tetra-ubiquitin chains were diluted to a concentration range between 1.45 μM – 0.0028 μM. Streptavidin Dip and Read biosensors (ForteBio, CA, USA) were hydrated with assay buffer for 10 min prior to the experiment. The monitoring conditions were as follows: Initial baseline for 60 s, loading for 120 s, quenching for 120 s, baseline for 30 s, association for 30 s, dissociation for 60 s; shake speed 1,000 rpm, and plate temperature 30° C. To de termine binding parameters the data were analyzed using ForteBio Data Analysis 9.0. The following concentrations of proteins were used: K48 tetraubiquitin [nM]: 1450, 483, 161, 53, 17, and 5.6; Med15 [nM]: 1000, 500, 250, and 125.
Tetraubiquitin and Med15 binding to Met4
Purified Met4 (residues 76 to 160) was immobilized on magnetic streptavidin beads (Dynabeads™ Streptavidin C1, Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA, USA). K48 tetraubiquitin (Tetra-Ubiquitin/Ub4 WT Chains, Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA, USA) was bound to immobilized Met4 in binding buffer (20mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0,05% NP40, pH 7.5) for 4 hr at room temperature. Beads were washed 3 times with 150 μL binding buffer, resuspended in binding buffer and distributed to 5 different tubes. The Met4/K48 tetraubiquitin complexes were then incubated for 1 h in a total volume of 10 μL containing either no Med15, or the following molar ratios compared to Met4 (Met4/Med15: 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3). The supernatant was analyzed for replaced K48 by immunoblotting. Proteins bound to Met4 were analyzed after 2 washes of the bead bound complexes with 150 μL binding buffer and elution in SDS loading buffer by immuno blotting.
ChIP analysis of recruitment to MET gene promoters
The targeted genes primers and materials used for ChIP was listed in the key resource table and Table S6. Wild-type, K11R, and Δmet4 mutants were used for analysis and the mediator binding was monitored by ChIP using the endogenously HA3-tagged mediator subunit Med14. Four Met4-dependent genes (MET3, MET17, CYS4, SAM2) and two Met4-independent genes (CCW12, CDC19) were analyzed.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The statistical data are from three independent experiments. Results are shown as mean ± SEM unless mentioned otherwise. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student t test for forward and reverse SILAC-based quantification. MS data were analyzed with Xcalibur 2.2 (Thermo Software).
