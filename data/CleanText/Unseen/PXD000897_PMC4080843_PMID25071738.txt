ABSTRACT:
Protein redox chemistry constitutes a major void in knowledge pertaining to photoautotrophic system regulation and signaling processes. We have employed a chemical biology approach to analyze redox sensitive proteins in live Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 cells in both light and dark periods, and to understand how cellular redox balance is disrupted during nutrient perturbation. The present work identified 300 putative redox-sensitive proteins that are involved in the generation of reductant, macromolecule synthesis, and carbon flux through central metabolic pathways, and may be involved in cell signaling and response mechanisms. Furthermore, our research suggests that dynamic redox changes in response to specific nutrient limitations, including carbon and nitrogen limitations, contribute to the regulatory changes driven by a shift from light to dark. Taken together, these results contribute to a high-level understanding of post-translational mechanisms regulating flux distributions and suggest potential metabolic engineering targets for redirecting carbon toward biofuel precursors.

Materials and methods
Bioreactor
A New Brunswick Scientific BioFlo 310 bioreactor with a custom 7.5 L vessel was used with a 5.5 L working volume maintained at 30°C with a 250 rpm agitation rate. The pH was held at 7.5 with controlled input of 2 M NaOH or 2 M HCl as needed. Bubbling was done with pure nitrogen at 0.75 L/min. Continuous culture was done with a dilution rate of 0.1/h, which is 9.2 mL/min media delivery rate in a 5.5 L working volume. Dilution rates during turbidostat control were varied by a custom control loop and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to maintain an optical-density setpoint by varying the flow rate of medium through the reactor. Lighting for the photobioreactor is provided by 32 illuminators, 16 at 630 nm, and 16 at 680 nm. Additionally, six LI-COR Biosciences quantum sensors were used to measure light intensities within the photobioreactor, three sensors for measuring incident light, and three sensors for measuring transmitted light.
The light control software, Biolume, allowed for proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control of incident or transmitted light intensity. All cultures were pre-grown in turbidostat mode for at least 24 h using 54 μmol m−2 s−1 fixed incident irradiance (Melnicki et al.,).
Turbidostat
A turbidostat was made by linking the voltage output of a transmitted light signal to the input of a BioFlo 310 controller. A custom loop and cascade control scheme was made to vary the flow rates of pumps to maintain a transmitted light voltage setpoint. The PID controller settings were tuned to allow fast but accurate control of the turbidity.
Medium composition
A modified version of ASP2 medium (A+ Medium) was used, which contained the following components per 1 L: 0.70 g NaOH, 0.030 g Na2-EDTA, 0.60 g KCl, 0.27 g CaCl2•2H2O, 5.0 g MgSO4•7H2O, 1 mL of P1 Metals solution (0.55 mM H3BO3, 0.022 mM MnCl2•4H2O, 0.0023 mM ZnCl2, 50 μ M CoCl2•6H2O, 18 μ M Na2MoO4•2H2O, and 12 μ M CuSO4•5H2O), 0.050 g KH2PO4, 18 g NaCl, and 0.91 g NH4Cl for 17 mM NH4Cl, or adjusted to 0.9 mM for nitrogen limitation. NaHCO3 was added after autoclaving to a final concentration of 40 mM except for carbon limitation when 7.7 mM was used.
Carbon limited steady state
For the C-limited steady state culture medium the NaHCO3 was reduced to 7.7 mM from 40 mM in the unlimited and N- limited cultures. The O.D. value (abs at 730 nm) was 0.36 at harvest.
Nitrogen limited steady state
For the N-limited steady state culture medium, the NH4Cl was reduced to 0.90 mM from 17 mM in the unlimited and C-limited cultures. The O.D. value (abs at 730 nm) was 0.36 at harvest.
Nutrient-replete (unlimited) steady state
Cells were grown in a turbidostat bioreactor. The O.D. (abs at 730 nm) was 0.18 at harvest.
Cell harvest, redox probe labeling, LC-MS sample preparation and quantitative analysis for in vitro and in vivo proteomics probe-labeled samples and global unlabeled samples
For each culture condition 20 mL samples were collected in 50 mL falcon tubes. For each condition, four sample aliquots were placed in the dark for 3 h and an additional 3 “light” sample aliquots were irradiated for 3 h. Post incubation, all samples were spun down at 4500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The “light” and “dark” samples were then decanted of media and the cell pellets were transferred with 500 uL PBS to 1.5 mL Eppendorf conical tubes. The probes were then added to the samples by addition of 1 uL each of 60 mM stock Mal-RP and IAM-RP. Probed samples were incubated in the dark for 60 min at 37°C with 250 rpm shaking. Next, samples were spun down at 4500 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet cells, and the supernatant was discarded. Also collected include two 20 mL sample aliquots from each nutrient condition, which were pelleted to be used for no probe control samples and another two 20 mL sample aliquots were pelleted for global proteome analysis. All cell pellets were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored till further sample preparation steps. Preparation for LC-MS analysis of probe-labeled and global samples, and quantitative data analysis was performed as described previously (Sadler et al.,). Details of LC-MS analysis are provided in the Supplemental Information text, and was performed as described previously (Sadler et al.,).
