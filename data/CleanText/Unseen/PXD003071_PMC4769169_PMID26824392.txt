ABSTRACT:
Mutations in Park8, encoding for the multidomain Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein, comprise the predominant genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). G2019S, the most common amino acid substitution activates the kinase two- to threefold. This has motivated the development of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors; however, poor consensus on physiological LRRK2 substrates has hampered clinical development of such therapeutics. We employ a combination of phosphoproteomics, genetics, and pharmacology to unambiguously identify a subset of Rab GTPases as key LRRK2 substrates. LRRK2 directly phosphorylates these both in vivo and in vitro on an evolutionary conserved residue in the switch II domain. Pathogenic LRRK2 variants mapping to different functional domains increase phosphorylation of Rabs and this strongly decreases their affinity to regulatory proteins including Rab GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). Our findings uncover a key class of bona-fide LRRK2 substrates and a novel regulatory mechanism of Rabs that connects them to PD.

Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative disorder of the nervous system that affects approximately 1% of the elderly population. Mutations in the gene that encodes an enzyme known as LRRK2 are the most common causes of the inherited form of the disease. Such mutations generally increase the activity of LRRK2 and so drug companies have developed drugs that inhibit LRRK2 to prevent or delay the progression of Parkinson’s disease. However, it was not known what role LRRK2 plays in cells, and why its over-activation is harmful.
Steger et al. used a 'proteomics' approach to find other proteins that are regulated by LRRK2. The experiments tested a set of newly developed LRRK2 inhibitors in cells and brain tissue from mice. The mice had mutations in the gene encoding LRRK2 that are often found in human patients with Parkinson’s disease. The experiments show that LRRK2 targets some proteins belonging to the Rab GTPase family, which are involved in transporting molecules and other 'cargoes' around cells. Several Rab GTPases are less active in the mutant mice, which interferes with the ability of these proteins to correctly direct the movement of cargo around the cell.
Steger et al.’s findings will help to advance the development of new therapies for Parkinson’s disease. The next challenges are to identify how altering the activity of Rab GTPases leads to degeneration of the nervous system and how LRRK2 inhibitors may slow down these processes.

Protein purification
Purification of Rabs and Rabin8 (Figures 2D, 2G, and 5E)
Buffer A: 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 500 mM LiCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 μM GDP, 2 mM beta-mercaptoethanol; Elution buffer: buffer A + 500 mM imidazole; Lysis buffer: buffer A + 1 mM PMSF and Roche Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (EDTA-free); Gel-filtration buffer: 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 μM GDP, 25 μM ATP, 2 mM DTT.
Rab isoforms and Rabin8 (153-237) were expressed as N-terminal His-Sumo fusion proteins in E. coli as described previously. The His-Sumo tag was removed using SENP1 protease. Transformed BL21 (DE3) harboring the GroEL/S plasmid were grown at 37°C to an OD 600 of 0.8, then shifted to 19°C and protein expression induced with Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mM) for 16 hr. Cells were pelleted at 5000 g (4°C for 20 min) and lysed by sonication (45% amplitude, 20 s pulse, 1 min pause, total of 10 min pulse) in lysis buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 g for 20 min at 4°C followed by incubation with 1 ml of Nickel-NTA agarose/l culture for 1 hr at 4°C. The resin was equilibrated on an AKTA FPLC with buffer A, and bound proteins eluted with imidazole gradient (25 mM-500 mM). Fractions containing the protein of interest were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled; 10 µg/ml His-SENP1 catalytic domain (residues 415–643) was used to cleave the His tag (16 hr at 4 oC). Imidazole was removed by buffer exchange gel filtration on a G25 column equilibrated in Buffer A plus 20 mM Imidazole. His-SENP1 protease was removed using Nickel-NTA agarose. Proteins were concentrated to a maximum of 10 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 10 kDa cut centricon and 0.5 ml samples were resolved on a high-resolution Superdex 200, 24 ml gel-filtration column equilibrated with gel filtration buffer and 0.2 ml fractions were collected. Peak fractions containing recombinant protein were pooled. Identity and purity of proteins were assessed by Maldi-TOF MS and SDS-PAGE.
Purification of Rab8a and Rabin8 (Figures 5D)
Human Rab8a (wt, T72E, T72A, residues 1-183) and human Rabin8 constructs (144-460 and 144-245) containing tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavable N-terminal 6-HIS tag were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 50 mM phosphate pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol. For Rab8a proteins 5 mM MgCl2 was added. Proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. To remove the N-terminal HIS tag, proteins were incubated with TEV protease overnight. Further purification was done by ion-exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose) followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT using a HiLoad Superdex 75 column. For Rab8a proteins 5 mM MgCl2 was added to the SEC buffer.
Mice
Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of Dundee (UK). All animal studies were ethically reviewed and carried out in accordance with Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the GSK Policy on the Care, Welfare and Treatment of Animals, regulations set by the University of Dundee and the U.K. Home Office. Animal studies and breeding were approved by the University of Dundee ethical committee and performed under a U.K. Home Office project license.
The LRRK2-G2019SGSK knock-in mouse line was generated by a targeting strategy devised to introduce the point mutation G2019S into exon 41 of the LRRK2 gene by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. 5’ and 3’ homology arms (approximately 4.8 and 3.8 kb, respectively) flanking exon 41 were generated using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs) on a C57BL/6J genomic DNA template. Similarly a 739 bp fragment carrying exon 41 lying between these two homology arms was isolated and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis with the QuickChangeII site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce the appropriate point mutation (GG to TC mutation at bps 107/8). The 5’ and 3’ homology arms and the mutated exon 41 fragments were subcloned into a parental targeting vector to achieve the positioning of the loxP and FRT sites and PGKneo cassette. Gene targeting was performed in de novo generated C57BL/6J-derived ES cells. The targeting construct was linearized and electroporated into ES cells according to standard methods. ES cells correctly targeted at the 3’ end were identified by Southern blot analysis of EcoRV digested genomic DNA using a PCR-derived external probe. Correct gene targeting at the 5’ end and presence of the point mutation was confirmed by sequencing of a ~6 kb PCR product. High-fidelity PCR of ES cell clone-derived genomic DNA using primers spanning the 5’ homology arm generated the latter. Correctly targeted ES cell clones were injected into BALB/c blastocysts and implanted into foster mothers according to standard procedures. Male chimaeras resulting from the G2019S targeted ES cells were bred with C57BL/6J female mice, and germline transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed by PCR. The PGKneo cassette was subsequently removed by breeding germline mice to FLPeR  mice expressing Flp recombinase from the Rosa26 locus (C57BL/6J genetic background). Absence of the PGKneo cassette in offspring was confirmed by PCR and subsequent breeding to C57BL/6J mice removed the Flper locus (confirmed by PCR). The line was maintained by breeding with C57BL/6J, and crossing mice heterozygous for the point mutation generated homozygous mice. Standard genotyping which distinguishes wild type from point mutation knock-in alleles was used throughout. Requests for LRRK2 G2019SGSK mice should be directed to: alastair.d.reith@gsk.com.
The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research generated the A2016T knock-in mice. A targeting vector was designed to introduce an alanine to threonine (A2016T) substitution at codon 2016 in exon 41 of the endogenous locus. In addition, an FRT-flanked neomycin resistance (neo) cassette was introduced 400 bp downstream of exon 41. The construct was electroporated into C57BL/6N-derived JM8 ES cells. Correctly targeted ES cells were injected into blastocysts and chimeric mice were bred to B6.Cg-Tg (ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J (JAX stock No. 005703) to remove the neo cassette and leave a silent FRT site. The resulting animals were crossed to C57BL/6NJ inbred mice (JAX stock No. 005304) for one generation. These mice are available from The Jackson Laboratory and for further information see http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/021828.html. The LRRK2-G2019SLilly were generated by Ely Lilly and maintained on a C57BL/6J background.
Genotyping of mice was performed by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from ear biopsies. For LRRK2-G2019SGSK knock-in mice, Primer 1 (5′-CCGAGCCAAAAACTAAGCTC -3′) and Primer 2 (5′-CCATCTTGGGTACTTGACC-3′) were used to detect the wild-type and knock-in alleles. For LRRK2-G2019SLilly knock-in mice Primer 1 (5′-CATTGCGAAGATTGCGGACTACTCAATT-3′) and Primer 2 (5′-AAACAGTAACTATTTCCGTCGTGATCCG-3′) were used to detect the wild-type and knock-in alleles. For LRRK2-A2016T Primer 1 (5′-TTGCCTGTGAGTGTCTCTGG-3′) and Primer 2 (5′-AGGAAATGTGGTTCCGACAC-3′) were used to detect the wild-type and knock-in alleles. The PCR program consisted of 5 min at 95°C, then 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C and 30 s at 72°C, and 5 min at 72°C. DNA sequencing was used to confirm the knock-in mutation and performed by DNA Sequencing & Services (MRC–PPU; http://www.dnaseq.co.uk) using Applied Biosystems Big-Dye version 3.1 chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 3730 automated capillary DNA sequencer.
For experiments shown in Figure 3F–G, homozygous LRRK2-G2019SLilly mice (3 months of age) were injected subcutaneously with vehicle (40% Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextran) or MLI-2 (3 mg/kg of body mass dissolved in 40% Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextran) and euthanized by cervical dislocation 1 hr after treatment. Brains were rapidly isolated and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. No specific randomization method or blinding was applied to experiments.
Generation of MEFs
Littermate matched wild type and homozygous LRRK2-A2016T mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from mouse embryos at day E12.5 resulting from crosses between heterozygous LRRK2-A2016T/WT mice using a previously described protocol. Cells were genotyped as described above for mice and wild type and homozygous A2016T knock-in cells generated from the same littermate selected for subsequent experiments. Cells cultured in parallel at passage 4 were used for MS and immunoblotting experiments.
Littermate matched wild type and homozygous LRRK2-G2019SGSK MEFs were isolated from mouse embryos at day E12.5 resulting from crosses between heterozygous LRRK2-G2019SGSK/WT mice as described previously. Wild-type and homozygous LRRK2-G2019SGSK/G2019SGSK MEFs were continuously passaged in parallel for at least 15 passages before being used for MS and immunoblotting experiments. All cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies). Littermate matched wild type and homozygous knock-out MEFs were isolated from LRRK2 knock-out mice as described previously. All knock-in and knock-out cell lines were verified by allelic sequencing.
Culture and transfection of cells
HEK293 were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Glutamax, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. The HEK293-t-rex-flpIn stable cell lines with doxycycline-inducible wild type and mutant forms of LRRK2 have been described previously. Transient transfections were performed 36-48 hr prior to cell lysis using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) or FuGene HD (Promega). LRRK2 expression in HEK293-t-rex-flpIn was induced by doxycycline (1 μg/ml, 24 hr). All cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination and overexpressing lines were verified by Western blot analysis.
Immunoprecipitations, pull-downs, and subcellular fractionation
For HA-Rab immunoprecipitations, HA-agarose (Sigma) was washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with lysates at a concentration of 25 μl of resin/mg lysate for 1 hr. Beads were then washed twice with 1 ml PBS and samples eluted in 2 x LDS (50 µl per 25 μl of resin) and centrifuged through a 0.22 μm Spinex filter, 2-mercpatoethanol added to 2% (v/v) and heated to 70oC for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE. For GFP pulldowns and immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in ice-cold NP-40 extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM EGTA, 15 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 1% NP-40 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Supernatants were incubated over night with Rab8 or Rab10 antibodies and bound complexes recovered using agarose protein A/G beads (Pierce). For GFP pull-downs, lysates were incubated with GFP beads for 2 hr (Chromotek). On bead digestion of protein complexes used for MS analysis was performed as described previously.
For subcellular fractionation, SILAC labeled HEK293 cells were counted and mixed in a 1:1 ratio after harvesting in PBS, spun at 1000 rpm at 4oC for 5 min and then resuspended in subcellular fractionation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Cells were then Dounce homogenized, left on ice for 20 min and spun at 750 g for 5 min. The supernatant spun in an ultracentrifuge (100,000 g) for 45 min to obtain cytosolic (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions.
Phos-tag SDS-PAGE
Phos-tag acrylamide and MnCl2 were added to a standard gel solution at a final concentration of 50 μM and 100 μM, respectively. After degassing for 10 min, gels were polymerized by ammonium persulfate and TEMED. Cell lysates used for Phos-tag SDS-PAGE were supplemented with MnCl2 at 10 mM to mask the effect of EDTA in the lysates. After SDS-PAGE, gels were washed 3 times with transfer buffer containing 10 mM EDTA followed by a wash with transfer buffer (10 min each). Blotting to nitrocellulose membranes was carried out according to a standard protocol.
Total proteome and phosphoproteome sample preparation and MS analyses
All samples were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (4% SDS, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5), boiled and sonicated, and precipitated overnight using ice-cold acetone (v/v= 80%). After centrifugation (4000 g), the pellet was washed at least twice with 80% ice-cold acetone before air drying and resuspension (sonication) in either urea (6 M urea, 2 M thiorurea, 50 mM Tris pH 8) or TFE buffer (10% 2-2-2-trifluorethanol, 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate [ABC]). Proteins were digested using LysC and trypsin (1:100), overnight at 37°C. Peptides for total proteome measurements were desalted on C18 StageTips and phosphopeptides were enriched as described previously.
LC-MS/MS measurements
Peptides were loaded on a 50 cm reversed phase column (75 µm inner diameter, packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 µm resin [Dr. Maisch GmbH]). Column temperature was maintained at 50°C using a homemade column oven. An EASY-nLC 1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was directly coupled online with a mass spectrometer (Q Exactive, Q Exactive Plus, Q Exactive HF, LTQ Orbitrap, Thermo Fisher Scientific) via a nano-electrospray source, and peptides were separated with a binary buffer system of buffer A (0.1% formic acid [FA]) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile plus 0.1% FA), at a flow rate of 250nl/min. Peptides were eluted with a gradient of 5-30% buffer B over 30, 95, 155, or 240 min followed by 30-95% buffer B over 10 min, resulting in approximately 1, 2, 3, or 4 hr gradients, respectively. The mass spectrometer was programmed to acquire in a data-dependent mode (Top5–Top15) using a fixed ion injection time strategy. Full scans were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with resolution 60,000 at 200 m/z (3E6 ions were accumulated with a maximum injection time of 25 ms). The top intense ions (N for TopN) with charge states ≥2 were sequentially isolated to a target value of 1E5 (maximum injection time of 120 ms, 20% underfill), fragmented by HCD (NCE 25%, Q Exactive) or CID (NCE 35%, LTQ Orbitrap) and detected in the Orbitrap (Q Exactive, R= 15,000 at m/z 200) or the Ion trap detector (LTQ Orbitrap).
Data processing and analysis
Raw MS data were processed using MaxQuant version 1.5.1.6 or 1.5.3.15 with an FDR < 0.01 at the level of proteins, peptides and modifications. Searches were performed against the Mouse or Human UniProt FASTA database (September 2014). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin, and the search included cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification and N-acetylation of protein, oxidation of methionine, and/or phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, Tyr residue (PhosphoSTY) as variable modifications. Up to two missed cleavages were allowed for protease digestion, and peptides had to be fully tryptic. Quantification was performed by MaxQuant, ‘match between runs’ was enabled, with a matching time window of 0.5-0.7 min. Bioinformatic analyses were performed with Perseus (www.perseus-framework.org) and Microsoft Excel and data visualized using Graph Prism (GraphPad Software) or R studio (https://www.rstudio.com/). Hierarchical clustering of phosphosites was performed on logarithmized (Log2) intensities. Significance was assessed using one sample t-test, two-sample student’s t-test, and ANOVA analysis, for which replicates were grouped, and statistical tests performed with permutation-based FDR correction for multiple hypothesis testing. Missing data points were replaced by data imputation after filtering for valid values (all valid values in at least one experimental group). Error bars are mean ± SEM or mean ± SD. Proteomics raw data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD003071.
LRRK2 inhibitor IC50 LRRK2 kinase assay
LRRK2 kinase activity was assessed in an in vitro kinase reaction performed as described previously. For IC50 determination of LRRK2 inhibitor, peptide kinase assays were set up in a total volume of 30 μl with recombinant wild type GST-LRRK2-(1326-2527) or mutant GST-LRRK2[A2016T]-(1326-2527) (6 nM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (~300-600 cpm/pmol), and 20 μM Nictide LRRK2 substrate peptide substrate, in the presence of indicated concentration of MLI-2. After incubation for 20 min at 30°C, reactions were terminated by applying 25 μl of the reaction mixture onto P81 phosphocellulose papers and immersion in 50 mM phosphoric acid. After extensive washing, reaction products were quantified by Cerenkov counting. IC50 values were calculated using non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). The IC50s for GSK2578215A against wild type GST-LRRK2-(1326-2527) or mutant GST-LRRK2[A2016T]-(1326-2527) are 10.9 nM and 81.1 nM, respectively, and the IC50s for HG-10-102-01 vs LRRK2 WT and A2016T are 20.3 nM and 153.7 nM, respectively. The IC50 of MLI-2 against wild type GST-LRRK2-(1326-2527) or mutant GST-LRRK2[A2016T]-(1326-2527) are 0.8 nM and 7.2 nM (see Extended Data Figure 1A). As MLI-2 displayed greater potency as well as a higher degree of resistance between wild type and A2016T mutation (9-fold compared to 7.4-fold for GSK2578215A and 7.6-fold for HG-10-102-01), we used MLI-2 for MS studies employing LRRK2[A2016T] knock-in MEFs.
In vitro kinase assays
Phosphorylation of Rab isoforms (Figures 2D, 2G, 2H and 4F)
LRRK2 kinase assays were performed using purified recombinant GST-tagged LRRK2 (960-2527, wt, D1994A, G2019S, Invitrogen) incubated with recombinant Rab isoform (1 μM). Proteins were incubated in kinase assay buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 5 mM NaF, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 10 μM ATP, and 0.5 μCi of γ-32P-ATP) at a combined volume of 30 μL. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 30 min, or as indicated. Reactions were quenched by the addition of SDS-sample loading buffer, heated to 70°C for 10 min and then separated on SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, gels were fixed (50% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid), stained in Coomassie brilliant blue, dried and exposed to a phospho-imaging screen for assessing radioactive 32P incorporation. For MS analysis, 100 μM of ATP was used and the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 M urea buffer (2 M urea in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5) containing LRRK2 inhibitor HG-10-102-01 (2 μM).
Phosphorylation of Rab isoforms (Figures 2C and 2F)
Assays were set up in a total volume of 25 μl with recombinant full-length Flag-LRRK2 (100 ng, Invitrogen) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (~300-600 cpm/pmol), with recombinant Rab isoform (1.5 µg) in the presence or absence of the LRRK2 inhibitor HG-10-102-01 (2 μM). After incubation for 30 min at 30°C, reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and reaction products resolved on SDS-PAGE. The incorporation of phosphate into protein substrates was determined by autoradiography. For phosphorylation of Rab8a or Nictide (Figure 1B) LRRK2 was immunoprecipitated from MEFs and kinase activity was assessed in an in vitro kinase reaction as described previously.
Phosphosite identification by MS and Edman sequencing (Figure 2—figure supplement 1)
Purified Rab1b and Rab8a (5 μg) were phosphorylated using recombinant full-length wild type Flag-LRRK2 (0.2 μg; Invitrogen) in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (~3000 Ci/pmol) for 1 hr at 30°C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels that were stained with Coomassie blue. The band corresponding to Rab1b/Rab8a was excised and digested overnight with trypsin at 30°C, and the peptides were separated on a reverse-phase HPLC Vydac C18 column (Separations Group) equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and the column developed with a linear acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions (0.1 ml each) were collected and analyzed for 32P radioactivity by Cerenkov counting. Phosphopeptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS using a Thermo U3000 RSLC nano liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data files were searched using Mascot (www.matrixscience.com) run on an in-house system against a database containing the appropriate Rab sequences, with a 10 ppm mass accuracy for precursor ions, a 0.6 Da tolerance for fragment ions, and allowing for Phospho (ST), Phospho (Y), Oxidation (M), and Dioxidation (M) as variable modifications. Individual MS/MS spectra were inspected using Xcalibur 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and Proteome Discoverer with phosphoRS 3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to assist with phosphosite assignment. The site of phosphorylation of 32P-labeled peptides was determined by solid-phase Edman degradation on a Shimadzu PPSQ33A Sequencer of the peptide coupled to Sequelon-AA membrane (Applied Biosystems) as described previously.
Phosphorylation of Rab8a (Figure 5D)
Rab8a was phosphorylated using LRRK2-G2019S (see ‘in vitro kinase assays’ section). Non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated Rab8a proteins were separated using ion-exchange chromatography (Mono S 4.6/100; GE Healthcare) with a linear salt gradient from buffer A (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) to buffer B (as buffer A, but with 1000 mM NaCl). The successful enrichment of phosphorylated Rab8a was confirmed by ESI-TOF MS.
Rab8a nucleotide binding experiments
Rab8a (1-183, wt and T72E) were subjected to HPLC revealing that the purified proteins were (>90%) in the nucleotide-free form. To determine affinities for G-nucleotides, fluorescence measurements were carried out at 20°C in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. Spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer; 1 µM of methylanthraniloyl (mant) labeled GMPPNP and GDP was incubated with increasing concentrations of wild type and T72E Rab8a in 60 µl volumes. Fluorescence of mant-nucleotides was excited at 355 nm and emission spectra monitored from 400 to 500 nm, with emission maxima detected at 448 nm. Intrinsic protein fluorescence and mant-nucleotide background fluorescence was subtracted from the curves. Data collection was performed with the program FL WinLab (PerkinElmer), while further analysis, curve fitting and dissociation constant (Kd) determination was done using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).
Guanine exchange factor (GEF) assays
Figure 5E: Purified Rab8a (100 μg) was phosphorylated using LRRK2 G2019S (1.5 μg) in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP (18 hr, room temperature [RT]) in a Dispo-Biodialyzer MWCO 1 kDa (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated in 2 l of the same Buffer to allow for ADP exchange. The buffer was subsequently exchanged to a GDP dissociation assay buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM MnCl2, 0.01% (w/v) Brij-35 using Zeba Spin desalting columns (Invitrogen). Phosphorylated Rab8a (50 μg) was treated with lambda phosphatase (5 μg) for 30 min at 30°C where indicated. To load mant-GDP, Rab8a was incubated with 40 μM mant-GDP in the presence of 5 mM EDTA at 30°C for 30 min. After adding MgCl2 at 10 mM, in order to remove unbound mant-GDP, the buffer was exchanged to a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl2 using Zeba Spin desalting columns. GDP dissociation reactions were set up in a total volume of 50 μl with 1 μM Rab8a:mant-GDP in 20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM GDP, and the reaction was started by adding the indicated concentration of Rabin8 (residues 153-237). Kinetic measurement of the mant fluorescence was carried out in a black half-area 96-well plate with PHERAStar FS (BMG Labtech) at RT using a set of filters (excitation: 350 nm, emission: 460 nm). The observed rate constant (kobs) and the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) were calculated as described previously. Phosphorylation stoichiometry (63%) was calculated by digestion of the protein with trypsin and analyzing the fragments by Orbitrap MS.
Figure 5D: Phosphorylated Rab8a was obtained as described in section ‘Phosphorylation of Rab8a’. GEF assays were performed as described previously. Loading of purified nucleotide-free (both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) Rab8a (1-183) with 2’(3’)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-GDP (mantGDP) was achieved by incubation with an 1.5 molar excess of mantGDP for 2 hr at RT. Unbound mantGDP was removed using a size-exclusion chromatography column. (Micro Bio-Spin column, Bio-RAD). The nucleotide exchange reactions were set up in a total volume of 50 μl in a quartz-glass cuvette (Hellma Analytics) with 0.5 μM mantGDP-bound Rab8a (non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated) using a GEF buffer containing 30 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM DTT and 10 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4. Purified Rabin8 (144-245, GEF domain) was subjected to size exclusion chromatography prior to GEF activity assay to ensure no loss of GEF activity due to storage. Rabin8 was added to a final concentration of 2 μM and incubated for 30 min at 20°C. The reactions were initiated by addition of GTP (1 mM cf). The dissociation of mant-GDP from Rab8a was monitored every 2 s for a total of 300 s at 20°C using a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer, 366 nm excitation and 450 nm emission). The observed rate constants (kobs) were calculated by fitting the data into a one-phase exponential decay equation without constraints using nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc).
Ni2+-NTA Rabin8 pull-down
Ni2+-NTA beads were pre-equilibrated with buffer containing PBS pH 7.4, 30 mM imidazole and 5 mM MgCl2. Purified HIS-tagged Rabin8 (residues 144-460) and untagged Rab8a (1-183) WT or quantitatively phosphorylated pT72 were mixed at equal molar ratios. Individual proteins and a mixture of the proteins were incubated with Ni2+-NTA beads for 1.5 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed 3 times with PBS, bound proteins eluted with 500 mM imidazole followed by SDS–PAGE and western blot analysis.
