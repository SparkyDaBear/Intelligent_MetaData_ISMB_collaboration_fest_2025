ABSTRACT:
Early cancers are avascular and hence, profoundly acidic. Pre-malignant cells must adapt to acidosis to thrive in this hostile microenvironment. Here, we investigate MCF-7 cells that are adapted to grow in acidic conditions using SILAC proteomics and we reveal a significant upregulation of lysosomal proteins. Prominent among these is LAMP2 that functions to protect lysosomal membranes from acid proteolysis. LAMP2 upregulation by acidosis is confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the depletion of LAMP2 is sufficient to increase acidosis-mediated toxicity. In breast cancer patient samples, there is a high correlation of LAMP2 mRNA and protein expression with progression. We also observe that LAMP2 is located at the plasma membrane in clinical samples and this redistribution is acid-induced in vitro. Our findings suggest a potential adaptive mechanism, wherein cells chronically exposed to an acidic environment translocate lysosomal proteins to their surface, thus protecting the plasmalemma from acid-induced hydrolysis.
 The protein LAMP2 functions to protect lysosomal membranes from acid proteolysis. In this study, the authors show that malignant cells adapt to the acidic tumour microenvironment by redirecting LAMP2 from lysosomes to the plasma membrane.

Methods
Cell culture and acid adaptation in vitro
MCF-7, MCF10-DCIS, MDA-MB-231 and ZR-75.1 cells were acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, 2007–2010) and were maintained in DMEM-F12 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories). Growth medium was further supplemented with 25 mmol l−1 each of PIPES and HEPES and the pH adjusted to 7.4 or 6.7. Acid-adapted cells were monitored by microscopy and confirmed to maintain their original morphology. Cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination and authenticated using short tandem repeat DNA typing according to ATCC's. To achieve acid adaptation, cells were chronically cultured and passaged directly in pH 6.7 medium for ∼3 months. Chronic low-pH-adapted cells underwent about 30 passages. Acid-adapted cells had similar growth rates to non-adapted cells.
SILAC labelling
Acid-adapted and naive cells were labelled by SILAC. Cells were cultured in heavy SILAC media (Δ6-lysine and Δ10-arginine) for eight doublings. Extent of labelling was determined by LC–MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides from labelled samples to ensure >98% labelling.
Lysis and digestion
Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer of 50% trifluoroethanol and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and protein was measured by the Bradford method. Protein from heavy- and light-labelled cells was combined in equal amounts, and lysis buffer was added to bring the final volume to 200 μl. The combined protein was reduced with 100 μl of 40 mM TCEP/100 mM dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteins were alkylated with 100 μl of 200 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at ambient temperature. The volume of the reduced and alkylated sample was brought to 1 ml with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. Trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:50 and samples were digested at 37 °C overnight. Digests were frozen at −80 °C and lyophilized. Dried peptides were resuspended in HPLC water with 0.1% TFA and desalted on 100-mg Thermo hypersep C18 columns. Eluted peptides were dried in a Speed-Vac and resuspended in HPLC water for isoelectric focusing fractionation.
Isoelectric focusing fractionation
Tryptic peptides were fractionated using a narrow-pH-range fractionation strategy previously described. At the end of the isoelectric focusing programme, strips were manually cut into 20 fractions. Peptides were extracted and samples were combined in the following manner to achieve 15 fractions for LC–MS/MS analysis: (anode end) samples 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8 and 9–10 were combined to make five fractions, samples 11–20 were left as individual fractions.
LC–MS/MS
Samples were analysed as duplicate injections for each fraction. A nano-flow ultra-high performance liquid chromatograph (RSLC, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) coupled to an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) was used for tandem MS peptide-sequencing experiments. The sample was first loaded onto a pre-column (2 cm × 75 μm ID packed with C18 reversed-phase resin, 5 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size) and washed for 8 min with aqueous 2% acetonitrile and 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid. The trapped peptides were eluted onto the analytical column, (C18 Pepmap 100, 75 μm × 50 cm ID, Dionex). The 120-min gradient was programmed as: 95% solvent A (2% acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid) for 8 min, solvent B (90% acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid) from 5 to 15% in 5 min, 15 to 40% in 85 min, then solvent B from 50 to 90% B in 7 min and held at 90% for 5 min, followed by solvent B from 90 to 5% in 1 min and re-equilibration for 10 min. The flow rate on the analytical column was 300 nl min−1. Ten tandem mass spectra were collected in a data-dependent manner following each survey scan. The MS scans were performed in the Orbitrap to obtain accurate peptide mass measurements, and the MS/MS scans were performed in the linear ion trap using a 60-s exclusion for previously sampled peptide peaks. Mascot (www.matrixscience.com) searches were performed against the UniProt human database downloaded on 11 July 11 2012. Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, the precursor mass tolerance was 1.2 Da to accommodate selection of different isotopes of the peptide precursor. MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.6 Da. Dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation (Cys), oxidation (Met), heavy lysine (Δ6) and heavy arginine (Δ10).
Quantification of differences in protein expression between SILAC-labelled samples was performed as described using MaxQuant. Results were filtered to require a posterior error probability (PEP) score <0.05 and summed intensity >0. Candidates were selected among proteins that consistently showed at least a 1.5-fold increase under low-pH conditions across label-flipping experiments.
LC-MRM
Using a nanoLC system (Easy-nLC, Thermo Scientific), 200 ng of unfractionated tryptic digest was loaded onto a trap column at 5 μl min−1 (C18PepMap100, Dionex, 300 μm × 5 mm), washed for 20 min, then eluted onto a column (75 μm × 15 cm ID, 3 μm particle size and 100 Å pore size Dionex). Peptides were eluted over a 25-min gradient (from 5–50% B) at a flow rate of 300 nl min−1. The solvent system was composed of aqueous 2% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (A) and aqueous 90% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B). LC-MRM was performed on a TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) spraying from 10-μm tips (New Objective, Woburn, MA) at 2,500 V with 200 °C transfer tube temperature, and 12 V skimmer offset. Acquisition parameters were as follows: Q1 was m/z 0.4 in width, Q3 was m/z 0.7 in width and each transition was monitored for 20 ms. Fragmentation was achieved with 1.5 mTorr argon. A minimum of three transitions was measured for each peptide. Quantification was achieved using the sum of the peak areas for all detected transitions using Skyline. The ratio of peak area of the endogenous peptide divided by the corresponding internal standard was calculated for each peptide in the sample to enable quantification of protein expression levels.
Transfections
For transfection of siRNA, cells were seeded in the cultures (5,000 cells per well in 96 wells) 3 days before the transfection. LAMP2 siRNAs (Trilencer-27: 27mer siRNA, Origene) were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen # 13778030) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To establish stable cell lines, the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with Plasmids expressing shRNA to LAMP2 (TR311794, Origene), LAMP2 overexpressing (RC221216, Origene) and red fluorescent protein or GFP expressing using Fugene 6 (Promega) at an early passage and were selected using 2 μg ml−1 puromycin (Sigma).
Western blotting
Acid-adapted and non-adapted DCIS, MCF-7, ZR-75.1 and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown with the same number of passages and used for whole-protein extraction. Lysates were collected using Insect Cell Lysis Buffer (554778; BD Biosciences) and RIPA buffer containing 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340; Sigma-Aldrich). Twenty micrograms of protein per sample was loaded on polyacrylamide–SDS gels, which later were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against rabbit polyclonal LAMP2 (1:1,000, ab37024 Abcam), rabbit poly clonal S100A6 (1:1,000, ab 75676 Abcam) and GAPDH (1:4,000, antirabbit; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Full blots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 12.
Immunofluorescence
Cells cultured at pH 6.7 chronically and pH 7.4 of with the same passage were rinsed with PBS, fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde for half an hour and then blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Samples were incubated with LAMP2 rabbit polyclonal primary antibody (1:100; ab 37024 Abcam) and secondary Alexa-Fluor 488 antirabbit (1:500) antibody. Coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Life Technologies) and images were captured with a Leica TCS SP5 (Leica) confocal microscope.
Dorsal window chamber
Tumour constructs were prepared using the tumour droplet method. MCF-7, ZR-75i, MCF-7 (GFP) or MDA-MB-231 (GFP) cells were suspended in 0.8 mg ml−1 of type-1 collagen (BD Bioscience #354249) and 1 × DMEM at a final concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells ml−1. Then, a 48-well non-tissue culture plate was used to place 5–15-μl drops (depends on the size of the tumour) of the tumour suspension in it. The droplets were polymerized in the centre of the well after 20–30 min of incubation at 37 °C. Next, 25 μl of 1.25 mg ml−1 collagen 1 was added to the surrounding of the tumour droplets. This helped the tumour droplets to have nicely defined borders. Then 200 μl of growth medium (DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum) was added to the wells and incubated in 37 °C.
Meanwhile, a DWC was prepared to implant into the recipient mice for nest 24–48 h of culturing the tumour droplet constructs. Constructs were added aseptically into the wound area right after the surgery. Intravital microscopy was started from 24–48 h after surgery to acquire tumour integrity and growth. To develop a pH map for each tumour and its microenvironment inside the chamber, we tail-vain-injected SNARF (a fluorescent molecule that has different emission in basic and acidic pHs) to the mice and imaged after 45 min. For SNARF imaging, we used excitation with an Argon laser tuned to 543 nm and emission was collected in 590–640 nm bandpass filter. Images were collected using an Olympus FV1000 MPE (multiphoton) microscope. Analysis was carried on using Image-Pro Plus v6.2 (Media Cybernetics; Bethesda, MD).
Tumour development and buffer therapy in mouse model
All animals were maintained in accordance with IACUC standards of care in pathogen-free rooms, in the Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute (Tampa, FL) Vivarium. One week before inoculation with tumour cells, ZR-75.1 cells (1 × 107) in the mammary fat pads, female nu/nu mice 6–8 weeks old (Charles River Laboratories) were placed in two cohorts per experiment, which were allowed to drink either tap water or 200 mM NaHCO3. ZR-75.1 tumours reached a tumour volume of 500 and 700 mm3, before the treatment with either tap water or 200 mmol l−1 NaHCO3. The weights of the water bottles were recorded before and after providing them to the animals, thereby tracking the amount of liquid consumed per cage. Animal weights were measured and recorded twice weekly, and the overall health of each animal was noted to ensure timely end points within the experiment. Finally, animals were humanely killed and tumours were extracted, fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin embedded and further processed for IHC.
Microarray analysis
Affymetrix expression data for LAMP2 and S100A6 genes in patient samples were produced from publicly available data sets. The CEL files for the tumour samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), data series GSE2109. Normal tissue data were from the GEO data series GSE7307, Human Body Index. The CEL files were processed and analysed using the MAS 5.0 algorithm (Affymetrix) and screened through a rigorous quality control panel to remove samples with a low percentage of probe sets called present by the MAS 5 algorithm, indicating problems with the amplification process or poor sample quality; high scaling factors, indicating poor transcript abundance during hybridization; and poor 30/50 ratios, indicating RNA degradation either before or during processing. The remaining samples were normalized to the trimmed average of 500 in the MAS 5 algorithm before comparison of the expression values across tumours and normal samples.
Immunohistochemistry
For mouse xenografts, tumours in the window chamber experiment were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Thermo Scientific) for 24 h, processed and embedded in paraffin. Routine haematoxylin and eosin stains were conducted on 4-μm sections of tissue. S100A6 and LAMP2 proteins were detected by IHC of their related antibodies using the Ventana Discovery XT automated system (Ventana Medical Systems). Rabbit polyclonal LAMP2 antibody (#ab37024 Abcam) and rabbit S100A6 antibody (Sigma HPA007575) were incubated at a dilution of 1:400. All antibodies were incubated for 32 min in Dako antibody diluent, followed by a 20-min incubation in Ventana OmniMap antirabbit secondary antibody and detected with the Ventana ChromoMap Kit system.
For human tissues, a TMA containing formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded human breast tissue specimens was constructed in Moffitt Cancer Center histology core. The TMA contains 27 normal breast tissue, 30 DCIS, 48 invasive ductal carcinomas without metastasis, 49 invasive ductal carcinomas with metastasis and 48 lymph node macrometastases of breast cancer. Cores were selected from viable tumour regions and did not contain necrosis. A 1:400 dilution of anti-LAMP2 (#ab37024, Abcam), anti-GLUT1 and anti-S100A6 antibody (Prestige Antibodies Powered by Atlas Antibodies, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as primary antibodies. Positive and negative controls were used. Normal placenta was used as a positive control for LAMP2, normal breast was used as a positive control for GLUT1 and normal kidney was used as a positive control for S100A6. For the negative control, an adjacent section of the same tissue was stained without application of primary antibody, and any stain pattern observed was considered as nonspecific binding of the secondary.
Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted using digitally scanning slides and scoring by three independent reviewers. The scoring method used by the pathologist reviewer to determine (1) the degree of positivity scored the positivity of each sample ranged from 0 to 3 and were derived from the product of staining intensity (0–3+). A zero score was considered negative, score 1 was weak positive, score 2 was moderate positive and score 3 was strong positive. (2) The percentage of positive tumours stained (on a scale of 0−3).
Statistical analysis
A two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was performed to compare treated and non-treated groups of animals and also for tumours against normal cells to determine statistical significance. The significance level was set as P<0.05.
Ethics statement
All procedures on animals were carried out in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal Resources (1996), National Research Council, and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, University of South Florida (IACUC# R4051).
Access to patient tissues samples was obtained following informed written consent of patients under a human subjects protocol (MCC16511) approved by the University of South Florida Institutional Review Board.
