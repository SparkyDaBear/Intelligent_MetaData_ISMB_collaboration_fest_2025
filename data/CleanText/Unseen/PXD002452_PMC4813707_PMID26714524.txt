ABSTRACT:
Pluripotency and self-renewal, the defining properties of embryonic stem cells, are brought about by transcriptional programs involving an intricate network of transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes. The Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex plays a crucial and dynamic role in the regulation of stemness and differentiation. Several NuRD-associated factors have been reported but how they are organized has not been investigated in detail. Here, we have combined affinity purification and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by protein identification by mass spectrometry and protein correlation profiling to characterize the topology of the NuRD complex. Our data show that in mouse embryonic stem cells the NuRD complex is present as two distinct assemblies of differing topology with different binding partners. Cell cycle regulator Cdk2ap1 and transcription factor Sall4 associate only with the higher mass NuRD assembly. We further establish that only isoform Sall4a, and not Sall4b, associates with NuRD. By contrast, Suz12, a component of the PRC2 Polycomb repressor complex, associates with the lower mass entity. In addition, we identify and validate a novel NuRD-associated protein, Wdr5, a regulatory subunit of the MLL histone methyltransferase complex, which associates with both NuRD entities. Bioinformatic analyses of published target gene sets of these chromatin binding proteins are in agreement with these structural observations. In summary, this study provides an interesting insight into mechanistic aspects of NuRD function in stem cell biology. The relevance of our work has broader implications because of the ubiquitous nature of the NuRD complex. The strategy described here can be more broadly applicable to investigate the topology of the multiple complexes an individual protein can participate in.
METHODS:
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture
The feeder independent 129ola strain derived ES cell line E14Tg2a was used for gene targeting. Cells were cultured in GMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA) according to standard procedures. Large scale cell culture was carried out by StemCell Technologies Inc. (Cambridge, UK).
Affinity Purification
Large scale affinity purification of Mta2-FTAP was performed essentially as described previously with the following modifications. The lysis buffer contained 450 mm NaCl and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The clarified lysate was diluted 1:3 to 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 before incubation with the beads. Affinity-purified proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation in 200 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide in elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm ε-aminocaproic acid). The eluate was concentrated in Vivaspin 500 centrifugal device (PES, 5000 Da cut-off, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) prior to BN-PAGE.
Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
The Native PAGE system from Life Technologies was used. Samples were mixed with 4×Native PAGE Sample Buffer (Life Technologies) and Native PAGE 0.5% G-250 Sample Additive (Life Technologies) was added to a final concentration of 0.05%. The electrophoresis was performed using Native PAGE 3–12% Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies). NativeMark Unstained Protein Standard (20kDa–1.2MDa, Life Technologies) was used as a molecular weight marker. Electrophoretic buffers were prepared and used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies). After one third of the migration distance, the cathode buffer was replaced by Light Blue Cathode Buffer. Coomassie staining was performed as described previously.
Size Exclusion Chromatography
A mouse ESC whole cell lysate was prepared as described previously and then treated with benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich, 90% purity, 1 μl per ml lysate). The lysate (2.5 mg total protein) was injected on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with diluted lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) using an AKTA Pure FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The flow rate was set at 0.5 ml/min and 28–500 μl fractions were collected in 96-deep-well plates. UV absorbance readings were acquired at 260 nm, 280 nm, and 214 nm. The fractions spanning the protein-containing part of the chromatograph were concentrated in Vivaspin 500 centrifugal devices (PES, 5000 Da cut-off) prior to PAGE.
Western Blotting
For denaturing PAGE, samples were separated in NuPAGE Bis-Tris 4–12% gels (Life Technologies) using MOPS running buffer according to manufacturer's instructions. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using XCell Transfer Kit and Transfer Buffer (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer's instructions. BN-PAGE gels were first incubated in 8% acetic acid prior to transfer to PVDF membranes (Life Technologies). Protein detection was performed using the following antibodies: FLAG (M2-peroxidase labeled, A8592, Sigma-Aldrich), Sall4 (ab29112, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), Chd4 (A301–081A, Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX), Hdac2 (sc-7899, Santa Cruz, Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX), Wdr5 (A302–430A, Bethyl Laboratories Inc.), Wdr5 (A302–429A, Bethyl Laboratories Inc.), and Rbbp4 (ab1765, Abcam).
LC-MS/MS Analysis
BN gels were excised into 48 identical (1.5 mm × 5 mm) slices and processed as described previously. Peptides were redissolved in 0.5% formic acid and analyzed with online nanoLC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) coupled with an Ultimate 3000 Nano/Capillary LC System (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Samples were first loaded and desalted on a nanotrap (100 μm id × 2 cm) at 10 μl/min with 0.1% formic acid for 10 min and then separated on an analytical column (75 μm id × 15 cm) (both PepMap C18, Dionex) over a 30 min linear gradient of 4–28% CH3CN/0.1% formic acid at 300 nL/min. The Orbitrap Velos was operated in standard data-dependent acquisition. The survey scans (m/z 380–1600) were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 30,000 at m/z 400, and one microscan was acquired per spectrum. The ten most abundant multiply charged ions with a minimal intensity of 3000 counts were subject to MS/MS in the linear ion trap at an isolation width of 2 Th. Dynamic exclusion width was set at ± 10 ppm for 45 s. The automatic gain control target value was regulated at 1 × 10e6 for the Orbitrap and 5000 for the ion trap, with maximum injection time at 150 ms for Orbitrap and 100 ms for the ion trap, respectively.
MS Data Analysis
Spectral analysis for protein identification and quantitation was performed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.1.2). The Mouse Uniprot reference proteome (January 2014; containing 51,159 entries) was used for the database search. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation and acetylation (N-terminal) were set as variable modifications. Trypsin was specified as protease, with a maximum of two missed cleavage sites allowed. Precursor mass tolerance was set at 4.5 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was set at 0.5 Da. The maximum false discovery rate was set at 0.01 for both peptide and protein identifications, based on hits to a reversed decoy database. MS data from the BN-PAGE fractions were processed in batch as separate experiments to derive independent quantification values for each fraction. The minimum ratio count was set to one, unique and razor peptides were used for quantification, and iBAQ values were computed. The proteinGroups results file was processed in Perseus (Version 1.5.0.31) for removal of contaminants, reverse IDs, and proteins only identified by site. We used five replicates of a nonrelevant FTAP2-tagged control (P. Tate, manuscript in preparation) affinity purification to draw a list of common nonspecific binding proteins in FLAG affinity purifications (data not shown). Data visualization and further processing was performed using scripts developed in R (Version 2.15.3). Hierarchical clustering was carried out using the average distance in a Manhattan distance matrix and the resulting clustering was visualized in a heat-map across all BN-PAGE fractions.
The raw MS data has been submitted to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD002452.
Bioinformatics Analyses of ChIP-seq Data Sets
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data sets for Chd4, Hdac1, Hdac2, Wdr5, Sall4, and Suz12 were retrieved from published studies (GEO repository accession numbers: GSE12482, GSE19588, GSE27970, GSE27844; ArrayExpress database accession numbers: E-MTAB-888, E-MTAB-889). All these data sets were derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. GO term enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID v6.7.
