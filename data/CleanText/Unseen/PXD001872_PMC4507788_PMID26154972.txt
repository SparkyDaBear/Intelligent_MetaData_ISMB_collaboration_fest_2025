ABSTRACT:
We present a novel mass spectrometry-based high-throughput workflow and an open-source computational and data resource to reproducibly identify and quantify HLA-associated peptides. Collectively, the resources support the generation of HLA allele-specific peptide assay libraries consisting of consensus fragment ion spectra, and the analysis of quantitative digital maps of HLA peptidomes generated from a range of biological sources by SWATH mass spectrometry (MS). This study represents the first community-based effort to develop a robust platform for the reproducible and quantitative measurement of the entire repertoire of peptides presented by HLA molecules, an essential step towards the design of efficient immunotherapies.

The cells of the immune system protect us by recognizing telltale molecules produced by damaged and diseased cells, or by infection-causing microorganisms (which are also called pathogens). To help with this process, the cells in our bodies display small fragments of proteins (called peptides) on their surface that are then checked by the immune cells. Collectively, these peptides are referred to as the ‘immunopeptidome’, and deciphering the complexity of the human immunopeptidome is important for both basic research and medical science. Such an achievement would help to guide the development of next-generation vaccines and therapies against autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases and cancers.
In the past, immune peptides were mostly identified using a technique that is commonly called ‘shotgun’ mass spectrometry. However, this approach doesn't always provide reproducible results. In 2012, researchers reported the development of a new approach—which they called ‘SWATH’ mass spectrometry—that could yield more reproducible data.
Now, Caron et al.—including many of the researchers involved in the 2012 study—have developed a large collection of standardized tests that use SWATH mass spectrometry to analyze the human immunopeptidome. The workflow and the computational and data resources developed as part of this international effort are the first steps toward highly reproducible and measurable analyses of the immunopeptidome across many samples. Moreover, the large repository of assays generated by the project has been made public and will serve a large community of researchers, which should enable better collaborations.
In the future, SWATH mass spectrometry could be used as a robust technology for the reproducible detection and measurement of pathogen-specific or cancer-specific immune peptides. This could greatly help in the design of personalized immune-based therapies.

METHODS:
Materials and methods
Blood samples, cell lines and synthetic peptides
PBMCs from healthy donors were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki protocol. HLA typing was carried out by the Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tübingen, Germany. PBMCs were stored at −80°C until further use. JYEBV+, Jurkat and C1R cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50ug/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Europe BV, Zug, Switzerland). C1R cells were stably transfected with -B2705, -B3901 and -B4002 constructs, as described previously. The EBV peptide was synthesized by Thermo Fischer Scientific (Ulm, Germany). The collection of 20,176 MTB peptides was synthesized by Mimotopes (Victoria, Australia) as described.
Isolation of HLA peptides
HLA class I peptide complexes were isolated by standard immunoaffinity purification as described previously using the pan-HLA class I-specific mAb W6/32.
RT normalization peptides
For the RT normalization and analysis, the peptides from the iRT Kit (Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland) were added to samples (see Figure 2—source data 1) prior to MS injection according to vendor instructions.
DDA mass spectrometry
AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600+
Both naturally presented and synthetic HLA peptides were analyzed using a TripleTOF system (see Figure 2—source data 1) as described before. Samples were analyzed on an Eksigent nanoLC (AS-2/1Dplus or AS-2/2Dplus) system coupled with a SWATH-MS-enabled AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600+ System. The HPLC solvent system consisted of buffer A (2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water) and buffer B (2% water with 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The samples were separated in a 75 µm-diameter PicoTip emitter (New Objective, Woburn, MA) packed with 20 cm of Magic 3 µm, 200 Å C18 AQ material (Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg, Germany). The loaded material was eluted from the column at a flow rate of 300 nl/min with the following gradient: linear 2–35% B over 120 min, linear 35–90% B for 1 min, isocratic 90% B for 4 min, linear 90–2% B for 1 min and isocratic 2% solvent B for 9 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in DDA top20 mode, with 500 and 150 ms acquisition time for the MS1 and MS2 scans respectively, and 20 s dynamic exclusion. Rolling collision energy with a collision energy spread of 15 eV was used for fragmentation.
Thermo scientific orbitrap ELITE
Mtb synthetic peptides were analyzed on an Eksigent LC system coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap ELITE mass spectrometer. Peptides were separated on a custom C18 reversed phase column (150 mm i.d. × 100 mm, Jupiter Proteo 4 mm, Phenomenex) using a flow rate of 600 nl min−1 and a linear gradient of 3–60% aqueous ACN (0.2% formic acid) in 120 min. Full mass spectra were acquired with the Orbitrap analyser operated at a resolving power of 30,000 (at m/z 400). Mass calibration used an internal lock mass (protonated (Si(CH3)2O))6; m/z 445.120029) and mass accuracy of peptide measurements was within 5 p.p.m. MS/MS spectra were acquired in CID and HCD mode with a normalized collision energy of 35%. Up to ten precursor ions were accumulated to a target value of 50,000 with a maximum injection time of 300 ms and fragment ions were transferred to the Orbitrap analyser operating at a resolution of 15,000 at m/z 400.
Thermo scientific orbitrap XL
Naturally presented HLA class I peptides from several PBMC samples (see Figure 2—source data 1) were also analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (nano-UHPLC, UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled with an LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid mass spectrometer. Samples were analyzed in five technical replicates. Sample volumes of 5 μl (sample shares of 20%) were injected onto a 75 μm × 2 cm trapping column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC; Thermo Fisher) at 4 μl/min for 5.75 min. Peptide separation was subsequently performed at 50°C and a flow rate of 175 nl/min on a 50 μm × 50 cm separation column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC; Thermo Fisher) applying a gradient ranging from 2.4 to 32.0% of acetonitrile over the course of 140 min. Eluting peptides were ionized by nanospray ionization and analyzed in the mass spectrometer implementing a top five CID method generating fragment spectra for the five most abundant precursor ions in the survey scans. Resolution was set to 60,000. For HLA class I ligands, the mass range was limited to 400–650 m/z with charge states 2 and 3 permitted for fragmentation.
Database search engines and statistical validation
All raw instrument data were centroided and processed as described previously. The datasets were searched individually using X!tandem, MS-GF+ and Comet against the full non-redundant, canonical human genome as annotated by the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (2014_02) with 20,270 ORFs and appended iRT peptide and decoy sequence. Oxidation (M) was the only variable modification. Parent mass error was set to ±5 p.p.m., fragment mass error was set to ±0.5 Da. The search identifications were then combined and statistically scored using PeptideProphet and iProphet within the TPP (4.7.0). All peptides with an iProbability/iProphet score above 0.7 were exported in Excel. Assumed charges were also exported, as this information is needed in SpectraST. Length considered was 8–12 residues for class I HLA peptides. FDR was manually estimated based on the target-decoy approach. Peptides (1% and 5% peptide-level FDR) were then exported to a .txt file for annotation to their respective HLA allele.
HLA allele annotation
Annotation of the identified peptides (1% and 5% peptide-level FDR) to their respective HLA allele was performed automatically by integrating the stand-alone software package of NetMHC 3.4 with our in-house software tools (Supplementary file 1 and Source code 1). An HLA annotation score was computed by the software tools for individual peptides (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). A predefined cutoff score of 3 was then used to annotate each peptide to their respective HLA allele. A cutoff value of 3 was selected because >90% of the identified peptides with an annotation score above 3 have a predicted IC50 below 1000 nM. FDR was corrected from the list of annotated HLA peptides based on the target-decoy approach. The software tools were used to process and visualize the peptidomic datasets. The final lists of HLA-allele specific peptides were exported into a .txt file and used in SpectraST for library generation.
Generation of HLA allele-specific peptide spectral and assay libraries
This section was adapted from. The parameters below were used for Spectrast. Exact meaning of each parameter can be found in the following link: http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:SpectraST. Spectrast was used in library generation mode with CID-QTOF settings (-cICID-QTOF) for the Triple-TOF 5600+ or CID (default) settings for the Orbitrap-XL and Orbitrap-ELITE. Retention times were normalized against the iRT Kit peptide sequences (-c_IRTiRT.txt -c_IRR). Only HLA-allele specific peptide ions were included for library generation (-cT):
spectrast -cNSpecLib_celltype_allele_fdr_iRT -cICID-QTOF -cTReference_celltype_allele_fdr.txt -cP0.7 -c_IRTiRT.txt -c_IRR iprophet.pep.xml
A consensus library was then generated:
spectrast -cNSpecLib_cons_celltype_allele_fdr_iRT -cICID-QTOF -cAC SpecLib_celltype_allele_fdr_iRT.splib
HLA-allele specific consensus libraries were merged:
spectrast -cNSpecLib_cons_celltype_alleles_fdr_iRT -cJU -cAC SpecLib_celltype_allele1_fdr_iRT.splib SpecLib_celltype_allele2_fdr_iRT.splib SpecLib_celltype_allele3_fdr_iRT.splib SpecLib_celltype_allele4_fdr_iRT.splib
The script spectrast2tsv.py (msproteomicstools 0.2.2; https://pypi.python.org/pypi/msproteomicstools) was then used to generate the HLA-allele specific peptide assay library with the following recommended settings:
spectrast2tsv.py -l 350,2000 -s b,y -x 1,2 -o 6 -n 6 -p 0.05 -d -e -w swaths.txt -k openswath -a SpecLib_cons_celltype_alleles_fdr_iRT_openswath.csv SpecLib_cons_celltype_alleles_fdr_iRT.sptxt
The _openswath.csv file was then converted into a .tsv file and opened in Excel. Reference coordinates for the 11 iRT peptides were confirmed and any remaining decoy sequences were removed. The file was then saved in .txt format and then converted back in .csv format. The OpenSWATH tool ConvertTSVToTraML converted the TSV/CSV file to TraML:
ConvertTSVToTraML -in SpecLib_cons_celltype_alleles_fdr_iRT_openswath.csv -out SpecLib_cons_celltype_alleles_fdr_iRT.TraML
Decoys were appended to the TraML assay library with the OpenSWATH tool OpenSwathDecoyGenerator as described before in reverse mode with a similarity threshold of 0.05 Da and an identity threshold of 1:
OpenSwathDecoyGenerator -in SpecLib_cons_celltype_alleles_fdr_iRT.TraML -out SpecLib_cons_celltype_alleles_fdr_iRT_decoy.TraML -method shuffle -append -exclude_similar
The library was then uploaded into the iPortal workflow for SWATH data analysis (see below).
DIA mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS)
For SWATH-MS data acquisition, the same mass spectrometer and LC-MS/MS setup was operated essentially as described before using 32 windows of 25 Da effective isolation width (with an additional 1 Da overlap on the left side of the window) and with a dwell time of 100 ms to cover the mass range of 400–1200 m/z in 3.3 s. Before each cycle, an MS1 scan was acquired, and then the MS2 scan cycle started (400–425 m/z precursor isolation window for the first scan, 424–450 m/z for the second... 1,174–1200 m/z for the last scan). The collision energy for each window was set using the collision energy of a 2+ ion centered in the middle of the window with a spread of 15 eV. Four independent international laboratories acquired their own SWATH maps using the settings described above: (1) Antony Purcell, Monash University; (2) Nicola Ternette, University of Oxford; (3) Miguel Marcilla, Spanish National Biotechnology Center; (4) Ruedi Aebersold, ETH-Zurich.
SWATH-MS data analysis
The iPortal workflow was used for data analyses. The OpenSWATH analysis workflow (OpenSWATHWorkflow) (http://www.openswath.org) was implemented in the iPortal workflow. The parameters were selected analogously to the ones described before: min_rsq: 0.95, min_coverage: 0.6, min_upper_edge_dist: 1, mz_extraction_window: 0.05, rt_extraction_window: 600, extra_rt_extraction_window: 100. pyprophet (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyprophet) was run on the OpenSwathWorkflow output adjusted to contain the previously described scores (xx_swath_prelim_score, bseries_score, elution_model_fit_score, intensity_score, isotope_correlation_score, isotope_overlap_score, library_corr, library_rmsd, log_sn_score, massdev_score, massdev_score_weighted, norm_rt_score, xcorr_coelution, xcorr_coelution_weighted, xcorr_shape, xcorr_shape_weighted. yseries_score). Assay libraries were loaded into Skyline and SWATH traces were analyzed as described previously.
