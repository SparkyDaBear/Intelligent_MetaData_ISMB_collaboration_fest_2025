ABSTRACT:
Despite significant efforts in the past decade towards complete mapping of the human proteome, 3564 proteins (neXtProt, 09-2014) are still “missing proteins”. Over one-third of these missing proteins are annotated as membrane proteins, owing to their relatively challenging accessibility with standard shotgun proteomics. Using non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as a model study, we aim to mine missing proteins from disease-associated membrane proteome, which may be still largely under-represented. To increase identification coverage, we employed Hp-RP StageTip pre-fractionation of membrane-enriched samples from 11 NSCLC cell lines. Analysis of membrane samples from 20 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal lung tissue were incorporated to include physiologically expressed membrane proteins. Using multiple search engines (X!Tandem, Comet and Mascot) and stringent evaluation of FDR (MAYU and PeptideShaker), we identified 7702 proteins (66% membrane proteins) and 178 missing proteins (74 membrane proteins) with PSM-, peptide-, and protein-level FDR of 1%. Through multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using synthetic peptides, we provided additional evidences for 8 missing proteins including 7 with transmembrane helix domains (TMH). This study demonstrates that mining missing proteins focused on cancer membrane sub-proteome can greatly contribute to map the whole human proteome. All data were deposited into ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD002224.

Cell Culture, Lysis and Tissue Collection
The human primary lung cancer cell lines: A549, CL100, CL141, CL152, CL25, CL83, CL97, H1975, H3255, PC9 and PC9/gef (Table S1) were obtained from Dr. Pan-Chyr Yang, National Taiwan University Hospital at Taipei, Taiwan and grown in RPMI 1640 medium. The cell cultures were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic at 37°C in 5% CO2. The cells were lysed using a hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl) with protease inhibitor cocktail (100:1, sample/protease inhibitor, v/v). The cells were homogenized using 50 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer.
Clinical tissue samples were obtained from National Taiwan University Hospital at Taipei, Taiwan in accordance with approved human subject guidelines authorized by Medical Ethics and Human Clinical Trial Committee at National Taiwan University Hospital. Following surgery, the tumor and adjacent normal tissues were collected in separate tubes, kept on dry ice for 30 mins. during transportation, and stored at -80 °C before further processing. Adjacent normal tissues were obtained from the distal edge of the resection ≥ 10 cm from the tumor. In this study, a total of 20 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal tissue were collected and analyzed from individual patients. All lung cancer patients had histologically been confirmed by pathologists. The detailed clinical information was shown in Table S2.
Membrane Protein Extraction and Digestion of NSCLC Cell Lines
The data of 11 NSCLC cell lines were taken from our previous study, and then re-analyzed in this work. Briefly, membrane proteins were isolated through a two-step centrifugation followed by gel-assisted digestion described previously. First, the nuclei and other heavy cell debris were separated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 mins. at 4 °C. Then the supernatant was mixed with 1.8 M sucrose to a final concentration of 0.25 M and was centrifuged for 1 h. at 13000 × g at 4 °C to pellet out the remaining membrane proteins. The pellet was then washed with 1 mL of 0.1 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) for 1 h., and recovered through centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 1 h. at 4 °C. Membrane proteins were then suspended in the digestion buffer (6 M urea, 5 mM EDTA, 2% SDS and 0.1 M TEABC) and then sonicated at 4 °C for 15 mins. Disulfide bonds were cleaved through incubation with 5 mM TCEP at 37 °C for 30 mins. and alkylated with 2 mM MMTS at room temperature for 30 mins. The membrane proteins were then embedded into the polyacrylamide gel directly formed in the sample tube. The gel was cut into small pieces and then washed several times with 25 mM TEABC and 25 mM TEABC in 50% ACN, then further dehydrated by adding 100% ACN. Trypsin in 25 mM TEABC was incubated with the membrane proteins (protein:trypsin = 10:1 g/g) for 16 h. at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel by sequential washing with 25 mM TEABC, 0.1% TFA, 0.1% TFA in 50% ACN and 100% ACN. The amount of peptide produced was determined using the BCA protein assay.
Tissue Membrane Protein Extraction and Digestion
Frozen tissues were thawed rapidly at 37 °C, cut into small pieces, weighed and then washed by 0.9% NaCl to remove blood. The pre-cleaned tissues were homogenized in STM buffer solution (5mL/g tissue, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, and 1 mM MgCl2) with protease inhibitor mixture (100:1, sample/protease inhibitor, v/v) using mechanical homogenizer (Precellys®24, Bertin Technologies) in 2.0 mL standard tubes (STURDY TUBE®) containing ceramic zirconium oxide beads (5 beads of 2.8 mm diameter and 10 beads of 1.4 mm diameter). The tissue samples were homogenized at 6500 rpm three times for 15 seconds pausing for 5 mins. in between each homogenization steps, and then tissue debris was removed by centrifugation (260 × g) for 5 mins. at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 mins. at 4 °C to pellet the nucleus, and then the obtained supernatant was centrifuged again at 13000 rpm for 1 h. at 4 °C to precipitate the crude membrane pellet. The pellet was washed in 1 mL of 0.1 M Na2CO3 overnight at 4 °C and re-collected by centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 1 h. at 4 °C. Digestion of the tissue membrane samples was performed using the gel-assisted digestion method described above.
Hp-RP StageTip Fractionation
Hp-RP StageTips were prepared as described from the protocol of Rappsilber et al. Briefly, 1.25 mg of 5 μm C18-AQ beads suspended in 100 mM ammonium formate (NH4HCO2, pH 10) in 50% ACN were packed into the Gilson 200-μL tip with a C8 membrane frit by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 mins. After sufficient washing and conditioning, membrane peptides reconstituted in the loading solution (200 mM NH4HCO2, pH 10) were bound to the StageTips through centrifugation. The membrane peptides were eluted from the tip with increasing concentration of ACN to separate the peptides into 6 fractions. Detailed procedure of the Hp-RP StageTip fractionation was previously described.
LC-MS/MS Analysis
Fractionated membrane peptides were analyzed using Synapt G1 High Definition Mass Spectrometer (HDMS, Waters Corp., UK) and TripleTOF 5600 System (AB SCIEX Concord, ON Canada). For LC-MS/MS analysis through Synapt G1 HDMS, the peptides reconstituted in buffer A (0.1% FA in H2O) were injected into a 2 cm × 180 μm capillary trap column and separated by 75 μm × 25 cm nanoACQUITY 1.7 μm BEH C18 column using nanoACQUITY Ultra Performance LCTM (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). For the analysis using TripleTOF 5600 System, peptide samples were injected into a 100 μm × 150 mm self-packed 3 μm C18-AQ column in a nanoACQUITY Ultra Performance LCTM. The bound peptides were eluted with a gradient of 0-80% buffer B (0.1% FA in ACN) for 120 mins., operated in ESI-positive V mode. The LC gradient for each Hp-RP StageTip fractions is previously described. Data acquisition for Synapt G1 HDMS was done by DDA mode to automatically switch between a full MS scan (400-1600 m/z, 0.6 s.) and six MS/MS scans (100-1990 m/z, 0.6 s. for each scan) on the six most intense ions present. Data from 5600 TripleTOF System were obtained through the same acquisition mode by selecting 15 most intense precursor peaks and performing 15 MS/MS (100-1800 m/z, 200 ms. for each scan) for each full MS scan (300-1600 m/z, 200 ms.). The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited into the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD002224.
Database Search for Peptide and Protein Identification
The acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot human database (2014_05 release, 20,264 entries) appended with reversed decoy sequences using Mascot (Matrix Science; version 2.3.02) with p-value < 0.05, and against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot human database (2014_11 release, 20,193 entries) with reversed sequences added for target-decoy analysis using X!Tandem, and Comet search engines. For database searches using X!Tandem and Comet, the .wiff raw files from 5600 TripleTOF system were first converted into mzML format by the MS Data Converter (AB SCIEX version 1.3 beta) using “centroid” option, and the resulting mzML files were further converted into mzXML format by the msconvert.exe from ProteoWizard (version 3.0.4462) package using default parameters. Raw files from Synapt G1 HDMS were converted directly into mzXML format using msconvert.exe. For database searching, a maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed for trypsin digestion with variable modifications of deamidation (Asn and Gln), oxidation (Met) and carbamidomethylation (Cys). In the Mascot search, a parent ion tolerance of 20.0 ppm and fragment ion tolerance of 0.1 Da for TripleTOF 5600 runs were used, and similar parameters were applied in both X!Tandem and Comet searches. For Synapt G1 HDMS runs 0.1 Da tolerance for both parent and fragment ion were used in the three search engines. Additional X!Tandem parameters include using top 160 peaks for matching, and default modifications: pyroglutamate from Gln and Glu and N-terminal acetylation. For Comet search, high resolution binning was used (0.02 tolerance and 0.0 offset).
To ensure high confidence in identification results, we further evaluated the FDR at PSM-, peptide- and protein-level. Search results from Mascot were imported into the PeptideShaker version 0.38.4 for peptide and protein inference. PSMs, distinct peptides and protein groups were validated at a 1% FDR estimated using the decoy hit distribution. Output files from X!Tandem and Comet were processed by PeptideProphet using the parameters “-OpdEAP -PPM”. The PepXML files from PeptideProphet were further combined using iProphet via the trans proteomic pipeline (TPP). The resulting protein and peptide identification lists were then determined by MAYU (version 1.07) based on 1% FDR. The parameters used for MAYU analysis are the following: “-I 2 -P pepFDR=0.01:t -G 0.1 -H 200 -PprotFeat –PmFDR”. Only proteins with protein FDR of 1% and with matched peptides passing the FDR threshold of 1% in both the peptide- and PSM-level, having at least one unique peptide were considered as identified. In addition, only peptides with at least 7 amino acid residues were accepted as confident identification.
Cellular Localization, Family/Domain, and Missing Protein Annotations
Membrane protein annotation was based on UniProtKB (http://www.uniprot.org/), neXtProt (http://www.nextprot.org/), and The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) (http://www.proteinatlas.org/). Missing protein annotation, protein existence evidence, and chromosome assignments were based on neXtProt (2014-09 release). TMH distribution was obtained from UniProtKB (2015_05 release). Family or domain annotation was performed by InterPro (v50.0). All the peptides were also cross-referenced to the peptide entries of the Peptide Atlas (http://www.peptideatlas.org/) repository (Human 2015-03).
MRM Method Development, Optimization and Acquisition
In order to further confirm the identification of some missing proteins, 14 synthetic peptide sequences of 11 missing proteins were purchased from Abomics Co. Ltd. (New Taipei City, Taiwan) with high purity of 95% and used to develop MRM method. The unique proteotypic peptides selected from the discovery mode used for the MRM fulfilled the following criteria: no cite susceptible to modification, no missed cleavage, and with the suitable length of 8 amino acids or more. The 14 peptides were divided into 5 groups (F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5/F6) based on the Hp-RP StageTip fractions in which they were detected in the DDA mode (Table S3). Five to eight most abundant MRM transitions for each peptide were selected having two or more unique ion signatures based from SRMCollider (v1.4). A total of 13 to 31 transitions were monitored for each Hp-RP StageTip fraction groups, with a maximum 10 transition analyzed simultaneously to allow a dwell time of 100 ms. or more.
All MRM acquisitions were performed using QTRAP5500 System (AB SCIEX Concord, ON Canada), and the peptide samples were injected in a 100 μm × 150 mm self-packed 3 μm C18-AQ column in a nanoACQUITY Ultra Performance LCTM. The same LC gradient optimized for each Hp-RP StageTip fraction as described previously were also used for the 14 synthetic peptides. The MS instrument was operated in positive mode with the following parameters: ion spray voltage of 2500 V, curtain gas at 25 psi, nebulizer gas at 20 psi, unit resolution (0.7 Da full-width-at-half-maximum) for both Q1 and Q3 quadrupoles, interface temperature at 150 °C, and scan mass range of m/z > 300 - 1250. The scheduled MRM was performed with 5-min retention time window and instrument cycle time of 1.5 s.
In MRM modes, collision energies (CE) and declustering potential (DP) were optimized. Using Skyline (version 3.1), the default CE used for the QTRAP 5500 instrument were calculated according to the formulas CE = 0.036 × (precursor m/z) + 8.857 and CE = 0.0544 × (precursor m/z) -2.4099, for doubly and triply charged precursor ions, respectively. For each parent ion, 11 different CE values (default CE ± 2V, 5 steps) were measured to obtain the optimized CE. The Skyline default DP for QTRAP 5500 calculated according to the formula DP = 0.0729 × (precursor m/z) + 31.117 and used for all peptides ranging from 62.2 V to 102.2 V. Further optimization did not generate noticeable increment in in the peak area. All MRM data analyses were performed using Skyline software.
