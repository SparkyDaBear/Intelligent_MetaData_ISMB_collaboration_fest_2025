ABSTRACT:
Resistance to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer is a major clinical problem. To identify pathways linked to resistance, we generated HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines which are resistant to either lapatinib or AZD8931, two pan-HER family kinase inhibitors. Resistance was HER2 independent and was associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), resulting in increased proliferation and migration of the resistant cells. Using a global proteomics approach, we identified a novel set of EMT-associated proteins linked to HER2-independent resistance. We demonstrate that a subset of these EMT-associated genes is predictive of prognosis within the ERBB2 subtype of human breast cancers. Furthermore, targeting the EMT-associated kinases Src and Axl potently inhibited proliferation of the resistant cells, and inhibitors to these kinases may provide additional options for the treatment of HER2-independent resistance in tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human breast cancer cell lines SKBR3 and BT474 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. SKBR3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 10% FCS (all Thermo Fisher Scientific). BT474 cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 10% FCS. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. A Leica DM IL LED microscope in conjunction with a QImaging Retiga EXi Fast 1394 camera was used to capture phase-contrast images of cells.
Generation of resistant cell lines
Lapatinib-resistant cells were established by culturing cells in complete medium supplemented with escalating concentrations of lapatinib (0.04–5 μM; SelleckChem). Cells were then maintained in 5 μM lapatinib. AZD8931-resistant cells were established by culturing cells in complete medium supplemented with escalating concentrations of AZD8931 (0.0067–0.67 μM; provided by AstraZeneca) and maintained in 0.67 μM AZD8931. Prior to drug treatment studies, the cells were grown for one week in the absence of drug.
Cell viability assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and allowed to attach for 24 hours. Escalating doses of lapatinib, AZD8931, dasatinib (Synkinase), foretinib (SelleckChem) or eCF506 (Footnote 1) prepared in DMSO were then added. After 72 hours, alamarBlue or PrestoBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) cell viability reagent was added and fluorescence measured after a further 60 minutes. Mean values were calculated from six replicate wells and normalized against the mean value of the vehicle (DMSO)-treated wells, and IC50 values were generated using Prism (GraphPad).
Western blotting
Cells were washed with PBS and then lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with cOmplete ULTRA protease inhibitor and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Cleared lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Primary antibodies used for western blotting were as follows: phospho-HER2/EGFR (phospho-tyrosine (pTyr)-1248/1273), phospho-HER2 (pTyr1221/1222), HER2, phospho-HER3 (pTyr1289), HER3, phospho-EGFR (pTyr992), EGFR, phospho-Akt (phospho-serine (pSer)-473), Akt, phospho-p44/42 MAPK (phospho-threonine (pThr)-202, pTyr204), p44/42 MAPK, E-cadherin, Slug, vimentin, YAP1 (all 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies), BAG3, CLIC4, fibronectin (all 1:1000; Abcam), Zeb1 (1:2000; Abcam), galectin-1, N-cadherin (all 1:1000; BD Biosciences), fascin-1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-tubulin (1:3000; Sigma-Aldrich), GAPDH (1:2500; Thermo Fisher Scientific).
RPPA analysis
Cells, in biological triplicate, were washed with PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM sodium chloride, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 10% glycerol, supplemented with cOmplete ULTRA protease inhibitor and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Cleared lysates were serially diluted to produce a dilution series comprising four serial two-fold dilutions of each sample, which were spotted onto nitrocellulose-coated slides (Grace Bio-Labs) in technical triplicate under conditions of constant 70% humidity using the Aushon 2470 array platform (Aushon Biosystems). Slides were hydrated in blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then incubated with validated primary antibodies (all 1:250; Supplementary Table S1). Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with anti-rabbit DyLight 800-conjugated secondary antibody (New England BioLabs). An InnoScan 710-IR scanner (Innopsys) was used to read the slides, and images were acquired at the highest gain without saturation of the fluorescence signal. The relative fluorescence intensity of each sample spot was quantified using Mapix software (Innopsys).
The linear fit of the dilution series of each sample was determined for each primary antibody, from which median relative fluorescence intensities were calculated. Signal intensities were normalized by global sample median normalization. Only primary antibodies with normalized signal intensities at least 1.5 times the value of the secondary antibody alone in at least one sample were included in the analysis to exclude data derived from weak or non-specific signals.
MS analysis
Parental SKBR3 and AZD8931-resistant SKBR3-AZDRc cell pellets (1 mg protein equivalent), in biological triplicate, were reconstituted in 8 M urea, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 20 mM dithiothreitol to denature and reduce the samples (30 minutes), followed by alkylation with 50 mM iodoacetamide (1 hour). Samples were digested with 10 μg trypsin overnight at room temperature. Peptide extracts were then cleaned on an SPE reverse-phase Bond Elut LMS cartridge (Agilent) and evaporated to dryness. Peptides were re-suspended in 2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water to give a final concentration of 1 μg/μL.
Peptides (4 μg) were subjected to nano-scale high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-MS using a nano-pump (Dionex Ultimate 3000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 300 μm × 5 mm pre-column (5 μm particle size, Acclaim PepMap; Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to a 75 μm × 50 cm column (3 μm particle size, Acclaim PepMap; Thermo Fisher Scientific). HPLC was coupled on-line to a Q Exactive instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) controlled by Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific; version 3.0.63) using Tune (version 2.3, build 1765). Samples were analyzed on a two-hour gradient using data-dependent analysis with one 70 k-resolution survey scan followed by the top five MS/MS scans at 17.5 k resolution.
Peak lists were generated using MSConvert (ProteoWizard; version 3.0.4462). MS data were searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database (Homo sapiens; 34,284 sequences; downloaded 12 January 2011) using Mascot software (version 2.4; Matrix Science). Up to two missed tryptic cleavage sites per peptide were permitted. Variable methionine oxidation and fixed cysteine carbamidomethylation modifications were allowed. Precursor and product ion mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.05 amu, respectively. A final peptide score of at least 20 and p < 0.05 (MudPIT scoring) were required, which resulted in a global false discovery rate of less than 1%.
Label-free quantification was performed using Progenesis LC-MS (version 4.1; Nonlinear Dynamics). Only MS peaks with a charge of 2+, 3+ or 4+ and the five most intense spectra within each feature were extracted from each LC-MS run for analysis. Normalization was first performed based on the sum of the ion intensities of these sets of multi-charged ions (2+, 3+, 4+). The associated unique peptide ion intensities for a specific protein were then summed to generate an abundance value, which was transformed using an ArcSinH function. The within-group means were calculated to determine the fold change between conditions, and the transformed data were used to calculate the p-values using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
MS data were deposited in ProteomeXchange (http://www.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) with the dataset identifier PXD002057 (DOI: 10.6019/PXD002057).
Hierarchical clustering analysis
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of normalized protein expression was performed on the basis of Pearson correlation using Cluster 3.0 (C Clustering Library, version 1.37), computing distances using a complete-linkage matrix. Clustering results were visualized using Java TreeView (version 1.1.1) and MultiExperiment Viewer (version 4.1.01).
Network analyses
Functional enrichment analysis was performed using BiNGO, assessing over-representation of GO terms describing biological processes using a hypergeometric test with Benjamini–Hochberg post hoc correction. Network clusters were generated from over-represented GO terms using Enrichment Map in Cytoscape (version 3.0.2), with a Jaccard coefficient cutoff of 0.25, and manually annotated. Interaction networks were constructed using GeneMania, clustered using the yFiles Organic algorithm in Cytoscape, and network topology was analyzed from undirected graphs using NetworkAnalyzer.
Cell migration assay
Cells were plated in duplicate at 3 × 103 cells per well in a 12-well plate in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 10 mM HEPES. Random migration was monitored by time-lapse video microscopy over 16 hours on an Olympus scan^R screening station. Total path length (accumulated distance) and net displacement (Euclidean distance) of individual cells were calculated using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Directional persistence of cell migration was calculated by dividing net displacement by total path length.
Survival analysis of gene expression data
Gene expression levels of the EMT-associated proteins that were over-expressed in the resistant cells were assessed in 289 ERBB2-subtype primary breast tumors from a compendium of 2999 tumors integrated from 17 studies, as previously described. Briefly, raw Affymetrix U133A/plus 2 .cel files were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE12276, GSE21653, GSE3744, GSE5460, GSE2109, GSE1561, GSE17907, GSE2990, GSE7390, GSE11121, GSE16716, GSE2034, GSE1456, GSE6532, GSE3494, GSE19615) and cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (geral-00143) repositories, summarized with Ensembl alternative CDF, normalized with RMA and integrated using ComBat to remove dataset-specific bias, as previously described. The intrinsic molecular subtypes were assigned based upon the highest correlation to the intrinsic subtype centroids. Survival analysis was performed using the survival R package.
