ABSTRACT:
Despite major advances in early revascularization techniques, cardiovascular diseases are still the leading cause of death worldwide, and myocardial infarctions contribute heavily to this. Over the past decades, it has become apparent that reperfusion of blood to a previously ischemic area of the heart causes damage in and of itself, and that this ischemia reperfusion induced injury can be reduced by up to 50% by mechanical manipulation of the blood flow to the heart. The recent discovery of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) provides a non-invasive approach of inducing this cardioprotection at a distance. Finding its endogenous mediators and their operative mode is an important step toward increasing the ischemic tolerance. The release of humoral factor(s) upon RIPC was recently demonstrated and several candidate proteins were published as possible mediators of the cardioprotection. Before clinical applicability, these potential biomarkers and their efficiency must be validated, a task made challenging by the large heterogeneity in reported data and results. Here, in an attempt to reproduce and provide more experimental data on these mediators, we conducted an unbiased in-depth analysis of the human plasma proteome before and after RIPC. From the 68 protein markers reported in the literature, only 28 could be mapped to manually reviewed (Swiss-Prot) protein sequences. 23 of them were monitored in our untargeted experiment. However, their significant regulation could not be reproducibly estimated. In fact, among the 394 plasma proteins we accurately quantified, no significant regulation could be confidently and reproducibly assessed. This indicates that it is difficult to both monitor and reproduce published data from experiments exploring for RIPC induced plasma proteomic regulations, and suggests that further work should be directed towards small humoral factors. To simplify this task, we made our proteomic dataset available via ProteomeXchange, where scientists can mine for novel potential targets.
METHODS:
Materials and Methods
This study was approved by the regional ethics committee for medical and health research in Western Norway (REK 2010/1642-1). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study conformed to the principles in the declaration of Helsinki. Six healthy adult male donors aged 29±2 years old (mean ± SD), not on any medication, underwent the RIPC protocol which consisted of 3 cycles of 5 min upper arm ischemia alternating with 5 min reperfusion (Figure 1). All subjects rested upright on a bench for 15 min before ischemia was induced by inflating a blood pressure cuff to 200 mmHg. Venous blood samples were collected from the ipsilateral arm after 14 min of rest in the beginning, and at 1 and 4 min into each reperfusion period. Blood samples were collected in K2 EDTA-coated tubes (Vacutainer, BD). Samples were centrifuged at 1,500 rcf at 4°C for 15 min within 30 min after sampling. 1.5 ml plasma was transferred to Eppendorf tubes before a second centrifugation at 15,000 rcf at 4°C for 15 min to remove any cell contaminants or cell fragments. ∼90% of the clear supernatant was removed using a 1 ml pipette and stored at −80°C. The whole process from sampling to freezing of each individual sample took less than 75 min. Samples from 1 and 4 min of each of the reperfusion periods were pooled, resulting in 12 samples: a sample before (control) and after RIPC for each of the six individuals.
Chemicals
Trypsin was purchased from Promega. N-octyl-β-D-glycopyranoside (NOG), acetonitrile (ACN), formic acid (FA), ammonium formate and water were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Water and ACN were of HPLC quality.
Abundant protein depletion and concentration
20 µl of plasma from each sample was depleted using a human Multiple Affinity Removal System (MARS Hu-14) 4.6 mm×50 mm LC column (Agilent Technologies) according to the protocol provided by the supplier, using a Dionex 3000-series LC system. The MARS column depletes the plasma of albumin, IgG, antitrypsin, IgA, transferrin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, IgM, apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein AII, complement C3 and transthyretin. The protein depleted plasma samples were concentrated using 3 kDa ultracentrifugation filters (Amicon Ultra-4, Millipore, Bedford, MA) pre-treated with 0.1% NOG.
Protein digestion and iTRAQ labeling
The entire depleted protein sample was reduced, cysteine blocked, trypsin digested (1∶20, trypsin∶protein, w/w), iTRAQ labeled (114, 115, 116 and 117) and combined according to the protocol using the chemicals provided (AB Sciex). The iTRAQ 4-Plex kit allowed us to multiplex two conditions from two donors per kit, resulting in three parallel experiments as detailed in Table 1. Both conditions (before and after RIPC) followed the exact same downstream workflow for every individual.
Mix-mode fractionation
iTRAQ labeled peptides were fractionated into 60 fractions using a mixed-mode (MM) reversed phase anion exchange (RP-AX) Sielc Promix column as described by Philips et al.  (MP-10.250.0530, 1.0×250 mm, 5 µm, 300 Å, Sielc Technologies, Prospect Heights, Illinois) coupled to an Agilent 1260 series LC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The iTRAQ labeled peptides were reconstituted in 20 mM ammonium formate, 3% ACN (buffer A) and loaded on the column in 85% buffer A for 10 minutes at a flowrate of 50 µl/min. The peptides were eluted from the column increasing the contents of buffer B (2 mM ammonium formate, 80% ACN, pH 3.0), from 15% to 60% in 35 minutes and further to 100% buffer over 10 minutes. Buffer B was held constant for 5 minutes before the column was equilibrated for 10 minutes in 85% buffer A. The fractions from the first 10 minutes of the gradient were discarded.
LC-MS/MS analyses
Fifty fractions from the MM RP-AX separation from each sample were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a Dionex Ultimate NCR-3000RS LC system. The fractions were dissolved in 1% FA and trapped on the pre-column (Dionex, Acclaim PepMap 100, 2 cm×75 µm i.d, 3 µm C18 beads) in buffer A (2% ACN, 0.1% FA) at a flowrate of 5 µl/min for 5 minutes before separation by reverse phase chromatography (Dionex, Acclaim PepMap 100, 15 cm×75 µm i.d., 3 µm C18 beads) at a flow of 280 nL/min. The fractions were run on three nano LC gradients: The first fifteen fractions were run on a LC gradient consisting of a gradient starting at 5% buffer B (90%ACN, 0.1% FA) ramping to 12% buffer B over 55 minutes (5–60 min), the gradient was subsequently ramped to 30% buffer B in 30 minutes (60–90 min), increased to 90% B in 10 minutes (90–100 min), held for 5 minutes (100–105 min) followed by ramping to 5% buffer B for 3 minutes (105–108) and equilibration of the column in 12 minutes (108–120); fractions 16–35 were separated on the following LC gradient: 0–5.0 minutes 5% buffer B, 5.0–5.5 minutes 8% buffer B, 5.5–60 minutes 20% buffer, 60–90 minutes 35% buffer B; the last fractions (36–50) were separated using the following gradient: 0–5.0 minutes 5% buffer B, 5.0–5.5 minutes 8% buffer B, 5.5–90 minutes 40% buffer. The last part of the nano LC gradient is similar for all three gradients.
The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent-acquisition (DDA) mode to automatically switch between full scan MS and MS/MS acquisition. The instrument was controlled by Tune 2.6.0 and Xcalibur 2.1. Survey full scan MS spectra (from m/z 300 to 2,000) were acquired in the Orbitrap with resolution R = 60,000 at m/z 400 (after accumulation to a target value of 1E6 in the linear ion trap with maximum allowed ion accumulation time of 500 ms). The 7 most intense eluting peptides above an ion threshold of 1,000 counts and charge states 2 or higher, were sequentially isolated in the high-pressure linear ion trap to a target value of 5E5 at a maximum allowed accumulation time of 1,000 ms, and isolation width maintained at 2 Da. Fragmentation in the Higher-Energy Collision Dissociation (HCD) cell was performed with a normalized collision energy of 40%, and activation time of 0.1 ms. Fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 7,500 with first mass fixed at m/z 100.
Data analysis
All RAW data were transformed into mgf peak lists using the ProteoWizard software package version 2.2.2954. The obtained peak lists were searched with OMSSA version 2.1.9 and X!Tandem Cyclone 2013.2.01.1 using SearchGUI version 1.12.2. Peak lists were searched against a concatenated target/decoy version of the human complement of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (downloaded on September 2012). The decoy sequences were created by reversing the target sequences in SearchGUI. Search settings were as follows: Trypsin with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages; 10 ppm as MS, 0.6 Da as MS/MS tolerances, respectively; fixed modifications: methylthio of Cys (+45.987721 Da) and iTRAQ on Lys and peptide N-term (+144.105918 Da); and variable modifications: oxidation of Met (+15.994915 Da) and iTRAQ on Tyr (+144.105918 Da). All other OMSSA or X!Tandem settings were kept at the default values set in SearchGUI. Peptides and proteins were inferred from the search engine results using PeptideShaker (http://peptide-shaker.googlecode.com). Peptide to Spectrum Matches (PSMs), peptides and proteins were validated at a stringent 1% FDR estimated using the decoy hits. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium(http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD000605 and DOI 10.6019/PXD000605.
For every validated protein, the iTRAQ reporter ions were extracted from spectra of validated PSMs and deisotoped using the isotope abundance matrix. Intensities were normalized using the median intensity in order to limit the ratio deviation and peptide and protein ratios were estimated using maximum likelihood estimators. Ratios were log2 converted and normalized to the median to avoid inter-sample bias. Only those proteins presenting two or more validated and quantified peptides were retained for the quantitative analysis. Standard contaminants as well as all proteins with known affinity to the antibodies in the MARS column were excluded from downstream statistical analysis. A paired two-sided t-test was conducted on protein ratios using a p-value threshold of 0.01. Subsequently, in order to distinguish RIPC specific regulations from random biological variability, an asymmetric normal distribution was drawn from the background ratios (calibrated on the median and ±34.1 percentiles) and only those proteins having a probability <1% to be derived from the background were considered confidently regulated. Finally, protein abundance indexes were estimated using spectral counting where the spectral counting index is simply the number of validated PSMs divided by the protein molecular weight.
