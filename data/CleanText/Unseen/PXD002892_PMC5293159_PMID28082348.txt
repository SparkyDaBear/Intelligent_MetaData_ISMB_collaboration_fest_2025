ABSTRACT:
Abstract
Protein–protein interaction networks (interactomes) define the functionality of all biological systems. In apoptosis, proteolysis by caspases is thought to initiate disassembly of protein complexes and cell death. Here we used a quantitative proteomics approach, protein correlation profiling (PCP), to explore changes in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactomes in response to apoptosis initiation as a function of caspase activity. We measured the response to initiation of Fas‐mediated apoptosis in 17,991 interactions among 2,779 proteins, comprising the largest dynamic interactome to date. The majority of interactions were unaffected early in apoptosis, but multiple complexes containing known caspase targets were disassembled. Nonetheless, proteome‐wide analysis of proteolytic processing by terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) revealed little correlation between proteolytic and interactome changes. Our findings show that, in apoptosis, significant interactome alterations occur before and independently of caspase activity. Thus, apoptosis initiation includes a tight program of interactome rearrangement, leading to disassembly of relatively few, select complexes. These early interactome alterations occur independently of cleavage of these protein by caspases.
METHODS:
Materials and Methods
Cell culture and induction of apoptosis
Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI‐1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada), 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen), and split 1:5 24 h prior to the induction of apoptosis. Cells were harvested and placed in fresh pre‐warmed media at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml for 2 h prior to the initiation of treatment. Apoptosis was initiated using anti‐Fas monoclonal antibody (CH11, EMD Millipore) at 250 ng/ml for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 24 h. At the desired time point, cells were collected, washed twice with ice‐cold PBS, and either snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C or fixed in 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min, washed with PBS, and stored in ice‐cold 70% (v/v) ethanol at −20°C. For the inhibition of caspase activity, the pan‐caspase inhibitor Z‐vad‐FMK was added at 20 μM for 1 h prior to initiation of anti‐Fas treatments.
SILAC labeling of Jurkat cells was accomplished as previous described (Stoehr et al, 2013). Briefly, RPMI‐1640 (Lys/Arg−/−) was supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada), 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and combinations of the following lysine and arginine isotopologues: for “light” or “L”‐labeled cells L‐arginine (34 mg/l) and L‐lysine (73 mg/l) (Sigma‐Aldrich, Oakville, ON); for “medium” or “M”‐labeled cells 13C6‐L‐arginine (35 mg/l) and D4‐L‐lysine (74.8 mg/l); and for “heavy” or “H”‐labeled cells 13C6 15N4‐L‐arginine (35.8 mg/l) and 13C6 15N2‐L‐lysine (76.6 mg/l) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA, USA). Cells were split 1:4 into the three SILAC media formulations and passaged five times for complete replacement of labeled amino acids. For each condition within biological replicate, 1 × 108 cells were used with cells harvested and placed in fresh pre‐warmed media at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml for 2 h prior to the initiation of treatment.
Flow cytometry
Flow‐based monitoring of DNA cleavage was accomplished using the APO‐BrdU TUNEL Assay kit (Invitrogen). Fixed cells were washed and prepared for DNA nicking/propidium iodide labeling according to manufactures instructions. Cells analyzed using a FACSCalibur system (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and data analyzed using FlowJo (v8.7).
Western blot
Cells were lysed on ice in freshly prepared RIPA lysis buffer [150 mM NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL® CA‐630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA (Roche)]. Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 relative centrifugal force (r.c.f.) for 20 min at 4°C, and protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay. Twenty micrograms of protein lysates was used for immunoblotting, with the proteins resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis‐Tris Gels (Invitrogen) run with 1× MOPS buffer (Invitrogen) for 45 min at 200 V. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes using a wet‐blotting system for 1 h at 400 mA. PVDF was blocked overnight in 5% skim milk powder in PBS‐T and then probed with primary and then secondary antibodies in 1% skim milk in PBS‐T, with three washes of PBS‐T between probes. Primary antibodies against PARP (# 9542, Cell Signaling), TACC3 Antibody (D‐2, sc‐48368, Santa Cruz), CDC‐42 (P1, SC‐87, Santa Cruz), cytochrome C (7H8.2C12, Abcam), NCAPH (HPA002647, Sigma‐Aldrich), and granzyme B (# 4275, Cell Signaling) were utilized at 1:5,000. Blots were developed with HRP‐conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000 in PBS‐T using chemiluminescence method (ECL) using either Hyperfilm detection (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) or digital detection using a Gel Doc™ XR+ System (Bio‐Rad).
Preparation of cytoplasmic complexes for PCP‐SILAC separation
Cell lysis and size exclusion chromatography were performed as described previously (Kristensen et al, 2012), with minor modifications. Briefly, after treatment cells were immediately harvested by centrifugation at 700 r.c.f. for 5 min, 4°C, and washed three times with ice‐cold PBS. Harvested cells of the same SILAC label were pooled and re‐suspended in 2 ml of ice‐cold size exclusion chromatography (SEC) mobile phase [50 mM KCl, 50 mM NaCH3COO, pH 7.2, containing Complete protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA (Roche), and additional phosphatase inhibitors (5 mM Na4P2O7, 0.5 mM sodium pervanadate)]. Cells were lysed by 200 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer, and insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 r.c.f. for 15 min at 4°C and lysates concentrated using 100,000 Da molecular weight cutoff spin columns (Sartorius Stedim, Goettingen, Germany). Equal amounts of protein from heavy‐labeled and medium‐labeled cells lysates were combined and immediately loaded onto a chromatography system consisting of two 300 × 7.8 mm BioSep4000 Columns (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) equilibrated with SEC mobile phase and separated into 80 fractions by a 1200 Series semi‐preparative HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 8°C. Fractions 1–55 corresponded to molecular weights 2 MDa to 100 kDa, as determined by the use of common SEC standards thyroglobulin, apoferritin, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma‐Aldrich) were considered for further analysis. The fractions from the light SILAC lysate served as an internal standard and were separated by SEC independently of the medium/heavy samples. To generate the PCP‐SILAC reference mixture, the first 55 fractions of the light SEC‐separated samples were pooled together and spiked into each of the corresponding medium/heavy fractions at a volume of 1:0.75 (medium/heavy to light).
In‐solution digestion of PCP‐SEC samples
Individual PCP‐SILAC samples were prepared using in‐solution digestion as previously described (Rogers et al, 2010). Briefly, sodium deoxycholate was added to each fraction to a final concentration of 1.0% (v/v) and samples boiled for 5 min. Boiled samples were allowed to cool to RT, then reduced for 60 min with 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature. Samples were then alkylated for 45 min with 40 mM iodacetamide (IAA) in the dark at room temperature and excess IAA quenched with 40 mM DTT for 20 min. Sequence‐grade trypsin (Promega) was added at a ratio of 50:1, and samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. Samples were acidified to pH < 3 with acetic acid, and the subsequently precipitated deoxycholic acid removed by centrifugation at 16,000 r.c.f. for 10 min. To ensure the removal of particulate matter, peptide digests were further clarified using Unifilter 800 Whatman filter plates (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The resulting peptide supernatant was purified using self‐made Stop‐and‐go‐extraction tips (StageTips) (Rappsilber et al, 2007) composed of C18 Empore material (3M) packed in to 200 μl pipette tips. Prior to addition of the peptide solution, StageTips were conditioned with methanol and equilibrated with 0.5% acetic acid (buffer A). Peptide supernatants were loaded onto columns and washed with three bed volumes of buffer A. Peptide samples were eluted with 80% MeCN, 0.5% acetic acid (buffer B) directly into a HPLC autosampler plate, dried down using a vacuum concentrator, and stored at 4°C.
Preparation of mitochondrial/organelle protein complexes for PCP‐BN separation
Mitochondrial/organelle preparations were prepared as previously described (Frezza et al, 2007). Briefly, Jurkat cells were harvested, washed with ice‐cold PBS, and suspended in ice‐cold, freshly prepared isolation buffer (200 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris–MOPS and 1 mM of EGTA/Tris, pH 7.4 with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA). Cells were gently lysed by 200 strokes with a pre‐chilled Dounce homogenizer on ice. The lysates were then clarified of nuclei and unbroken cells by centrifugation at 800 r.c.f. for 10 min at 4°C. Mitochondrial/organelle preparations were collected by 7,000 r.c.f. for 10 min at 4°C, washed once with ice‐cold isolation buffer, and prepared immediately for BN‐PAGE. SILAC samples were prepared in parallel with the same buffers to enhance consistency between preparations.
BN‐PAGE separation was performed as outlined by Wittig et al (2006). Freshly prepared mitochondrial/organelle preparations were suspended in membrane extraction buffer [4% digitonin stock, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 2.5 mM 6‐aminohexanoic acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.0] and tumbled for 15 min at 4°C to extract protein complexes. Samples were clarified by centrifugation using 16,000 r.c.f. for 10 min at 4°C and the resulting supernatant mixed with a ¼ of the volume of 50% glycerol and ¼ of the volume of 5% Coomassie blue G‐250. Membrane complexes were separated using 3–12% gradient NativePAGE™ Bis‐Tris gels (Life technologies) with Native running and cathode buffer (Life technologies). Medium and Heavy protein complex extracts were mixed immediately before running of the gels. Gel separation was performed at 4°C, 200 V and gels fixed (10% methanol, 7% acetic acid in Milli‐Q water) for 1 h followed by staining overnight with Coomassie blue G‐250 (Sigma).
In‐gel digestion of PCP‐BN samples
Separated protein complexes were processed as previously described (Shevchenko et al, 2006), with minor modifications. Briefly, gel‐separated samples were excised into 55 equal gel slices using a OneTouch GridCutter (Gel Company, San Francisco, CA, USA) and destained in a 50:50 solution of 50 mM NH4HCO3: 100% ethanol for 20 min at room temperature with shaking at 750 rpm. Destained bands were then washed with 100% ethanol, vacuum‐dried for 20 min, and rehydrated in 10 mM DTT in 50 mM NH4HCO3. Reduction was carried out for 60 min at 56°C with shaking. The reducing buffer was then removed, and the gel bands washed twice in 100% ethanol for 10 min to ensure the removal of remaining DTT. Reduced ethanol‐washed samples were sequentially alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM NH4HCO3 in the dark for 45 min at room temperature. Alkylated samples were then washed twice with 100% ethanol and vacuum‐dried. Alkylated samples were then rehydrated with 12 ng/μl trypsin (Promega, Madison WI) in 40 mM NH4HCO3 at 4°C for 1 h. Excess trypsin was removed; gel pieces were covered in 40 mM NH4HCO3 and incubated overnight at 37°C. Peptide samples were extracted from gel bands twice using four gel volumes of 30% ethanol 3% acetic acid followed by four gel volumes of 100% ethanol with the supernatant from each extraction pooled. The 0.75 volumes of the resulting pooled peptide extracted mixture from the light reference sample was then added to each fraction from the pooled heavy and medium gel digests. The resulting peptide mixtures were dried down, desalted using C18 StageTips (Rappsilber et al, 2003), and stored on tip at 4°C. Peptides were eluted in buffer B and dried before analysis by LC‐MS.
N‐terminal peptide enrichment by TAILS
Protein N‐termini were enriched as previously described (Kleifeld et al, 2010, 2011). Labeled cytoplasmic samples were mixed 1:1:1 and precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) on ice for 10 min. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 16,000 r.c.f. for 10 min at 4°C, washed with ice‐cold acetone, air‐dried then re‐suspended in 6 M GuHCl, and heated to 99°C for 5 min. Samples were diluted in 3 volumes dH20 and 1 M HEPES pH 8 added to a final concentration of 100 mM. 1 M DTT was added to a final concentration of 5 mM, and samples were incubated 30 min at 60°C. Samples were cooled to room temperature, 100 mM iodoacetamide added to a final concentration of 15 mM, and sample incubated 20 min at room temperature. 2 M CH2O was added to each sample to a final concentration of 40 mM followed by 1 M NaBH3CN to a final concentration of 20 mM. The pH was adjusted to between 6 and 7 and samples incubated overnight at 37°C. Fresh CH2O and NaBH3CN were added, and samples incubated for an additional 1 h at 37°C to ensure complete amine labeling. Excess CH2O was quenched by adding 1 M NH4HCO3 to a final concentration of 100 mM, the pH adjusted to between 6 and 7, and samples incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Samples were precipitated with 20% TCA; 1 volume TCA per 4 sample volumes was added and incubated 10 min at 4°C. Proteins were pelleted at 16,000 r.c.f for 5 min and washed 3× with 500 μl ice‐cold acetone. Proteins were re‐suspended in ice‐cold 100 mM NaOH and then adjusted to 1 mg/ml in 50 mM HEPES pH 8. Trypsin was added at a protease:protein ratio of 1:100 and incubated > 18 h at 37°C. HPG‐ALDII (FlintBox, http://flintbox.com/public/project/1948/) was added at a HPG‐ALDII:peptide ratio of 5:1 and coupling commenced by the addition of 1 M NaBH3CN to a final concentration of 20 mM. The pH was adjusted to between 6 and 7, and samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. 1 M NH4HCO3 was added to a final concentration of 100 mM to quench the HPG‐ALDII, and samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Unbound peptides were collected by using a 10K spin column (Amicon Ultra‐0.5 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel‐10 membrane), cleaned up using C18 StageTips (Rappsilber et al, 2003), and stored 4°C.
Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis
Prior to LC‐MS analysis, samples were re‐suspended in 15 μl buffer A. LC‐MS was performed on either an Agilent 1290 Series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON) coupled to LTQ‐Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) for the establishment of Fas apoptosis time points and development of the PCP‐BN‐PAGE method or an EASY‐nLC1000 system coupled to a Q‐Exactive for biological replicates of the quantitative studies. LC‐MS was accomplished using a two column system in which samples were concentrated prior to separation on a 2‐cm‐long, 100‐μm‐inner‐diameter fused silica trap column containing 5‐μm Aqua C18 beads (Phenomenex) and then separated using an in‐house‐packed C18 analytical 75‐μm inner diameter, 360‐μm outer diameter column composed of 35 cm ReproSil‐Pur C18 AQ 1.9 μm (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch‐Entringen, Germany) column for the EASY‐nLC1000 system, or a 20 cm ReproSil‐Pur C18 AQ 3 μm for the Agilent 1290 Series HPLC. Samples were concentrated onto the trap for 10 min using 100% buffer A at 5 μl/min after which the gradient was altered from 100% buffer A to 40% buffer B over 180 min at 250 nl/min with the eluting peptides infused directly into the mass spectrometers via nESI. Both instruments were operated in a data‐dependent manner using Xcalibur v2.2 (Thermo Scientific). For samples analyzed on the LTQ‐Velos, one full precursor scan in the Orbitrap (resolution 60,000; 350–1,600 Th, AGC target of 1 × 106) was followed by the selection of the top ten most intense, multiply charged ions above 1,000 counts for collision‐induced dissociation (normalized collision energy 35, activation Q, 0.25; activation time, 10 ms, AGC of 4 × 104) with 30‐s dynamic exclusion enabled. For samples analyzed on the Q‐Exactive, one full precursor scan (resolution 70,000; 350–2,000 m/z, AGC target of 3 × 106) was followed by 10 data‐dependent HCD MS‐MS events (resolution 17.5 k AGC target of 1 × 106 with a maximum injection time of 60 ms, NCE 28 with 20% stepping) with 25‐s dynamic exclusion enabled. TAILS samples were analyzed on a Q‐Exactive with the parameters optimized for greater spectral quality with one full precursor scan (resolution 70,000; 350–2,000 m/z, AGC target of 3 × 106) followed by ten data‐dependent HCD MS‐MS events (resolution 35 k AGC target of 1 × 106 with a maximum injection time of 110 ms, NCE 28 with 35% stepping).
Data analysis
MaxQuant (v1.4.1.2 or 1.5.0.0) (Cox & Mann, 2008) was used for identification and quantification of the resulting experiments, with the resulting cytoplasmic and membrane biological replicates searched together to ensure a global false discovery rate of < 1% in accordance with the work of Schaab et al (2012). Database searching was carried out against the UniProt/Swiss‐Prot human database (downloaded 24/10/2013) (84,843 entries) with the following search parameters: carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification; oxidation of methionine, acetylation of protein N‐termini, trypsin/P cleavage with a maximum of two missed cleavages. A multiplicity of three was used, with each multiplicity denoting one of the SILAC amino acid combinations (light, medium, and heavy, respectively). The precursor mass tolerance was set to 6 parts‐per‐million (ppm) and MS/MS tolerance 0.5 Da for LTQ‐Velos data or 10 ppm for Q‐Exactive data, with a maximum false discovery rate of 1.0% set for protein identifications. To enhance the identification of peptides between fractions and replicates, the Match between Runs option was enabled with a precursor match window set to 2 min and an alignment window of 10 min. The resulting protein group output was processed within the Perseus (v1.4.0.6) analysis environment to remove reverse matches and common proteins contaminates prior to analysis with MATLAB R2012a (http://www.mathworks.com). Enrichment analysis was performed within Perseus, utilizing Cellular Component GO terms and the CORUM database (Ruepp et al, 2010).
Terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates data were converted to MGF using MSConvert (Chambers et al, 2012) and then searched using MASCOT 2.5. Data files were search using semi‐ArgC specificity, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification and the following variable modifications: Acetyl (N‐term), Dimethyl (K), Dimethyl (N‐term), Gln‐>pyro‐Glu (N‐term Q), Label:13C(6) (R), Label:13C(6)15N(2) + Dimethyl (K), Label:13C(6)15N(4) (R), Label:2H(4) + Dimethyl (K), Oxidation (M). A precursor and product tolerance of 20 ppm was used against the UniProt/Swiss‐Prot human database (84,843 entries). Quantitation of resulting TAILS peptides was accomplished using Skyline v3.1 utilizing the MS1 full scan features (Schilling et al, 2012). Four quantitation channels were created as follows; light, corresponding to no modified lysine or arginine residues; Light_dimethyl, corresponding to dimethylated lysine and unlabeled arginine; medium, corresponding to dimethylated lysine‐4 and arginine‐6; and heavy, corresponding to dimethylated lysine‐8 and arginine‐10. The results from Mascot searches were used to generate spectral libraries that were then used to extract quantitative values for the four possible channels. The resulting results were compiled and filtered using MATLAB to generate a complete list of the quantitative values for all peptides which pass a 1% FDR. For statistical analysis, multiple hypothesis corrections were implemented using a Benjamini–Hochberg correction threshold below 0.02 for enrichments analysis, 0.2 for TAILS fold change analysis, and Bonferroni correction below 0.05 for PCP‐SILAC fold change analysis. Cleavage motif analysis of dimethylated N‐termini peptide observed to change in response to treatments were accomplished using pLogo (O'Shea et al, 2013).
MATLAB‐based analysis
All experiments were processed using the bioinformatics approach outlined within Scott et al (2015). In addition to the Gaus.m, Alignment.m, Comparison.m and PPI.m scripts described previously, additional scripts membrane.m, peptide_mapping.m, and cluster.m were created to further enhance the analysis and visualization of data. The precision of protein interaction networks generated during analysis was calculated at two levels, at the local level; corresponding to all interactions within an isotopologue channel of a single experiment, and at the global level; corresponding to the combined precision of all interaction across all isotopologue channels and replicates. The desired precisions of 70, 60, and 50% were generated by optimization of the parameters required to reach these precisions threshold at the local level within a given isotopologue channel and then combining the determined interactions into a single networks. Membrane.m enables GO terms possessed by assigned interactions to be assessed based on the percentage of membrane‐associated GO terms and matching terms. Peptide_mapping.m enables the analysis and visualization of peptide information for individual protein groups within a PCP experiment, similarly to a previous report (Stoehr et al, 2013). Clustering was accomplished using a Markov clustering approach (Enright et al, 2002; Guruharsha et al, 2011; Babu et al, 2012). Peptide quantitative information is utilized to assess evenness and diversity using a Shannon index (Shannon & Weaver, 1949; Bent & Forney, 2008).
Microscopy and co‐localization analysis
Cells for microscopy were subject to the same growth and treatment/control conditions as the cells destined for proteomic analysis. Following treatment, the cells were moved to tubes, centrifuged for 5 min at 200 RCF, and the culture medium removed. The cells were re‐suspended in PBS containing 200 nM MitoTracker Orange (ThermoFisher Scientific, M7510) for 30 min at 37°C to label mitochondria. Following this, 1.5 × 105 cells in a 0.5 ml volume were centrifuged onto 12‐mm‐diameter, thickness 1.5 glass coverslips for staining and microscopy. The cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti‐CDC24 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc‐8401) at 1:50, and rabbit purified polyclonal anti‐IQGAP1 (BD Biosciences, HPA014055) at 1:100 for 30 min at room temperature. Goat anti‐mouse Alexa Fluor 594 and goat anti‐rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies were applied at a 1:500 dilution, together with 1 μM TO‐PRO‐3 iodide to visualize nuclei (ThermoFisher Scientific, A‐11032, A‐11034, and T3605, respectively). Microscopy was performed on a Leica SP5 using a pinhole of 1 Airy unit, and image data were collected at a depth of 12‐bit per channel. Excitation wavelengths for Alexa Fluor 488, MitoTracker Orange, Alexa Fluor 594, and TO‐PRO‐3 were 488‐, 543‐, 594‐, and 633‐nm laser lines, and emission windows on the spectral scanning unit were set to 493–540, 550–590, 600–645, and 645–740 nm, respectively. Images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ (Schindelin et al, 2015). Noise was reduced by applying Gaussian Blur 3D with a value of 1 in all dimensions, and Spearman's rank correlation values were determined as the measure of colocalization for each cell as a hand‐selected region‐of‐interest (Dunn et al, 2011). Statistical significance of changes in colocalization upon stimulation of apoptosis was assessed by performing a Mann–Whitney U‐test with a 95% confidence interval for treated cells showing mitochondrial or nuclear morphological changes associated with apoptosis vs. untreated cells that showed no such morphological signs.
Granzyme B activity assays
Cells were grown and treated as for the proteomics experiments. Following 4‐h treatments, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and re‐suspended in 0.1 ml of the assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.05% CHAPS, 5 mM DTT) lysed by 20 passages through the 26‐gauge syringe needle and spun down (16,000 r.c.f., 10 min at 4°C). One half of each supernatant was incubated with 50 μM Compound 20 (Willoughby et al, 2002; provided in kind by Dr. David Granville, UBC) for 30 min on ice to specifically inhibit granzyme B activity. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the substrate Ac‐IEPD‐pNA (20 μM final; Grujic et al, 2005). Release of pNA was monitored by the absorbance at 405 nm and using the SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 37°C. The calculated rates were normalized per total protein (as measured by Bradford assays in the same lysates) with experiments preformed in biological triplicate.
