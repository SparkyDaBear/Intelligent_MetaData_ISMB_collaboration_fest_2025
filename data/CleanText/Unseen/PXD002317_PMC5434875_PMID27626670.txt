ABSTRACT:
Summary
Most aging hypotheses assume the accumulation of damage, resulting in gradual physiological decline and, ultimately, death. Avoiding protein damage accumulation by enhanced turnover should slow down the aging process and extend the lifespan. However, lowering translational efficiency extends rather than shortens the lifespan in C. elegans. We studied turnover of individual proteins in the long-lived daf-2 mutant by combining SILeNCe (stable isotope labeling by nitrogen in Caenorhabditis elegans) and mass spectrometry. Intriguingly, the majority of proteins displayed prolonged half-lives in daf-2, whereas others remained unchanged, signifying that longevity is not supported by high protein turnover. This slowdown was most prominent for translation-related and mitochondrial proteins. In contrast, the high turnover of lysosomal hydrolases and very low turnover of cytoskeletal proteins remained largely unchanged. The slowdown of protein dynamics and decreased abundance of the translational machinery may point to the importance of anabolic attenuation in lifespan extension, as suggested by the hyperfunction theory.

Strains
GA154 glp-4(bn2ts)I;daf-2(e1370)III (long-lived) and GA153 glp-4(bn2ts)I daf-16(mgDf50)I; daf-2(e1370)III (reference strain) were kindly provided by David Gems at the University College of London. The strains were maintained as described previously. The transgenic lines generated by biolistic transformation and crossing were daf-2(e1370)III;jrIs5[unc-119(+) rps-0p∷mls∷Dendra2] and daf-16(m26)I;daf-2(e1370)III; jrIs5[unc-119(+) rps-0p∷mls∷Dendra2]. The strains glp-4(bn2)I;daf-2(e1370)III;jrEx17[rla-1p∷rla-1∷Dendra2] and glp-4(bn2)I;daf-2(e1370)III;jrEx18[asp-4p∷asp-4∷Dendra2] were created by microinjection.
SILeNCe
Metabolic 15N and 14N Labeling of the Escherichia coli Bacteria
E. coli K12 was freshly grown overnight at 37°C while shaking at 120 rpm in minimal medium containing 42 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KHPO4, 9 mM NaCl, trace elements (17 mM EDTA, 3.1 mM FeCl3·6H2O, 0.62 mM ZnCl2, 0.076 mM CuCl2·2H2O, 0.042 mM CoCl2·6H2O, 0.16 mM H3BO3, and 0.0068 mM MnCl2·6H2O), glucose 20% (w/v), 1 mM MgSO4, 0.3 mM CaCl2, 0.0041 mM biotin, 0.0033 mM thiamin, and 93 mM 15N- or 14N-containing NH4Cl (0.22-μm filter, sterilized). Fully labeled bacterial cultures were obtained by inoculating a single colony with an inoculation loop into 250 ml of minimal medium. Overnight cultures reached an optical density of approximately 1.5 (A550) and were concentrated 50-fold.
Culturing and Sampling of C. elegans
Synchronized L1 nematodes were plated on nitrogen-free agarose (1.2%) plates containing NaCl (0.3%), cholesterol (0.0005%), 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, and 25 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 6.0) and a lawn of freshly grown 14N-labeled E. coli K12 cells. To prevent dauer formation, glp-4(bn2ts)I; daf-2(e1370)III were grown at 17°C until the third larval stage (L3) and then switched to 24°C for the remainder of the experiment. Worms that had freshly molted to adults (adult day 0) were washed three times and transferred into culture flasks (not exceeding 1,500 worms/ml) containing S-basal (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM potassium phosphate [pH 6.0]), 12.93 μM cholesterol, 75 μM 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Acros Organics), and 14N-labeled E. coli K12 cells (A550 = 1.0). On day 2 of adulthood, worms were collected and washed thoroughly (2 × S-basal, 1 × S-basal containing 2.5 mM EDTA, 2 × S-basal) to remove bacteria. Next, worms were pulsed in new culture flasks containing S-basal, 12.93 μM cholesterol, 75 μM 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Acros Organics), and 15N-labeled E. coli K12 cells (A550 = 1.0). From this moment, worms were sampled after 0, 15, 20, 27, 40, and 72 hr of 15N pulsing. Animals were washed thoroughly (2 × S-basal, 1 × S-basal containing 2.5 mM EDTA, 2 × S-basal) to remove bacteria, after which dead worms were removed via Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich) washing. The worm pellet was resuspended in 200 μl denaturing solution (8 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, and 50 mM TrisHCl [pH 8.0]) and immediately dripped into liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The sample size was chosen based on our previous study. We sampled all the different post-pulse time points in five biological replicates for both glp-4(bn2ts)I daf-16(mgDf50)I; daf-2(e1370)III and glp-4(bn2ts)I; daf-2(e1370)III.
Quantitative Proteomics
Randomized Study Design
Samples were processed in batches comprising all the biological replicates of both reference and daf-2 worms sampled at one time point post-labeling. Samples within a batch were analyzed blindly and in random order (Table S3).
Preparation of the Tryptic Peptide Samples
The frozen worm beads (∼1,500 worms in denaturing solution) were homogenized using a BioPulverizer (BioSpec) pre-conditioned in liquid nitrogen. The fine powder was recovered into a 1.5-ml tube, thawed, centrifuged (2 min, 5,000 rpm), and sonicated for 30 s in a 5510 Branson ultrasonic water bath (Branson Ultrasonics). Protein concentrations were determined using a Coomassie assay. Further sample processing steps, LC/MS peptide identification, and data processing strategies are provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Functional Analysis and Data Visualization
The UniProtKB Protein Knowledgebase (UniProt 2015), the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID 2014), and Wormbase (version WS246) were used for protein annotation and evaluation of functionally and spatially related proteins (Table S4). Heatmap visualization of different protein half-lives was done with the MultiExperiment Viewer, part of the TM4 microarray software suite. Euclidean distances between proteins were calculated and used as a distance metric in a hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) together with an average pairwise distance as linkage method. Graphs and statistical tests (including tests for normality) were performed with GraphPad Prism version 6.05 for Windows (GraphPad).
Correlation Analysis of Protein Abundance and Half-Lives
In total, 167 common proteins were detected comparing the SILeNCe dataset with the previously obtained proteomic dataset of (Table S2). The “dietary restriction” condition was removed from the latter, and the set was re-normalized. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between log2-transformed ratios of protein abundance and protein half-lives (log2 fold change) (GraphPad Prism version 6.05 for Windows).
Dendra2
jrIs5[unc-119(+)rps-0p∷mls∷Dendra2] was created using biolistic transformation (PDS-1000/He System, Bio-Rad) to study mitochondrial turnover. This reporter is a concatenate of the ubiquitous ribosomal protein subunit promoter rps-0p, the gas-1 mitochondrial localization sequence, and the Dendra2 gene (Evrogen). This transgenic strain was crossed with the daf-2(e1370)III mutant. The reference strain was obtained by crossing the latter strain with the daf-16(m26)I genetic background. An device emitting intense violet light was hand-built (4 × 20 W, 415-to420-nm light emitting diodes (LEDs), Zhuhai Tianhui Electronics) for mass photoconversion of worms without affecting lifespan and fecundity (data not shown). Residual UV and heat produced by the LEDs were eliminated using UV filters and heat mirrors, respectively. Day 1 adult worms were photoconverted during 30 min and, subsequently, red Dendra2 fluorescence intensity was measured at regular time points using a Victor2 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer). Fluorescence was normalized to protein content as determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). The slopes, representing mitochondrial Dendra2 turnover, were evaluated in GraphPad Prism using linear regression analysis.
Ribosomal and lysosomal protein degradation was assayed by microinjecting an rla-1p∷rla-1∷Dendra2 or asp-4p∷asp-4∷Dendra2 construct containing a 2-kb upstream and 1-kb downstream sequence of the respective gene in the glp-4(bn2)I;daf-2(e1370)III mutant. Synchronized L1 worms were grown on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with freshly induced RNAi bacteria (L4440 empty vector and daf-16), incubated at 17°C until the third larval stage (L3), and then switched to 24°C for the remainder of the experiment. daf-16 RNAi resulted in the expected abrogation of the longevity phenotype of glp-4;daf-2 worms (Figure S5). On the second day of adulthood, worms (n = 6/condition) were photoconverted and immediately imaged using confocal microscopy. Subsequently, worms were rescued and replaced on fresh RNAi plates. After 48 or 96 hr, the same individuals were re-imaged using the same camera settings specific for each animal. Confocal images were acquired using a Nikon TiE-C2 confocal microscope with objectives Plan 4× 0.10 chrome-free infinity-corrected (CFI) (numerical aperture [NA] 0.1, dry), 20× CFI Plan Apochromat VC (NA 0.75, dry), and Plan Apo VC 60×A WI differential interference contrast (DIC) N2 (NA 1.20, water immersion [WI]) and the NIS Elements imaging software (version 4.13.03). The Dendra2 fluorochrome was excited with a 561-nm solid-state laser, and the emission was collected with a 605/55-nm band-pass filter. The mean intensity per pixel of red Dendra2 fluorescence was determined with ImageJ. Protein half-lives were calculated as the fractional decline of red fluorescence per hour based on two measured time points.
