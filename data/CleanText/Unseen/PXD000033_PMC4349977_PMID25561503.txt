ABSTRACT:
The reversible phosphorylation of proteins on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is an important biological regulatory mechanism. In the context of genome integrity, signaling cascades driven by phosphorylation are crucial for the coordination and regulation of DNA repair. The two serine/threonine protein kinases ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) are key factors in this process, each specific for different kinds of DNA lesions. They are conserved across eukaryotes, mediating the activation of cell-cycle checkpoints, chromatin modifications, and regulation of DNA repair proteins. We designed a novel mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics approach to study DNA damage repair in Arabidopsis thaliana. The protocol combines filter aided sample preparation, immobilized metal affinity chromatography, metal oxide affinity chromatography, and strong cation exchange chromatography for phosphopeptide generation, enrichment, and separation. Isobaric labeling employing iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) was used for profiling the phosphoproteome of atm atr double mutants and wild type plants under either regular growth conditions or challenged by irradiation. A total of 10,831 proteins were identified and 15,445 unique phosphopeptides were quantified, containing 134 up- and 38 down-regulated ATM/ATR dependent phosphopeptides. We identified known and novel ATM/ATR targets such as LIG4 and MRE11 (needed for resistance against ionizing radiation), PIE1 and SDG26 (implicated in chromatin remodeling), PCNA1, WAPL, and PDS5 (implicated in DNA replication), and ASK1 and HTA10 (involved in meiosis).
METHODS:
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Plant Material
Arabidopsis thaliana wild type plants and mutant lines (double homozygous offspring of a double heterozygous atm atr line (atm-2: Salk_006953; atr-2: Salk_032841) were in ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0). Wild type and mutant lines were grown side-by-side under long day conditions (16 h light, 8 h dark, 21 °C; 60 to 80% humidity, 5800 LUX, 3× Philips TLD 36W, and 2× Sylvana GroLUX 36W). Homozygous atm atr mutant plants were identified by PCR using 35 cycles, standard conditions and the following primers: ATM-F1 (5′-GCTTCAAGGTTGGGCAGTTCC-3′), ATM-R1 (5′-GCAAACAGCATAACAAAACACTTCC-3′), and Lbc1 (5′-TGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACTCT-3′) and primers: atr2–1 (5′-GGATCAAGTACTACTGACTCAG-3′), atr2–3 (5′-CAACTCATTTTGAATATGAGAG-3′), and Lba1 (5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′), respectively. Genotypes were validated in duplicate by PCR. For irradiation experiments, plants were exposed to 100 Gy ionizing radiation using a Co60 source (25 Gy min−1) at the developmental stage 5.10. For each sample, the aerial parts of three plants were harvested 15 min after irradiation. Samples were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C.
Protein Extraction
Frozen plant tissue samples were homogenized in a liquid nitrogen-chilled cryogenic mill. For each sample, 1 ml prechilled protein extraction buffer (4% SDS (Merck), 50 mm Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (TCEP, Sigma-Aldrich), 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5 (Sigma-Aldrich)) was added to 170 mg of powdered plant material and incubated at 95 °C under strong agitation for 5 min. The samples were sonicated at room temperature for 1 min and incubated at 95 °C under strong agitation for further 5 min. After centrifugation (10 min, 20,000 × g at room temperature), the supernatant was cleared by a second centrifugation step.
Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP)
Peptides were generated by a modified FASP protocol. In brief, 1 ml of plant cell lysate was mixed with 9 ml of 8 m UH-buffer (8 m urea (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA), 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.5) containing 2 mm TCEP and loaded on an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with a 30 kDa molecular weight cutoff (Millipore). All buffer exchanges were performed by centrifugation at 4000 × g at room temperature. The first buffer exchange (UH buffer) was repeated twice, followed by alkylation of proteins by addition of 40 μl of 200 mm methylmethanethiosulfonate (MMTS, Fluka) for 30 min at room temperature. MMTS was removed by performing two buffer exchanges using 8 m UH-buffer, followed by two further buffer changes using 0.8 m urea, 50 mm Triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB, Fluka). Trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Promega, Madison, WI) was added to 1 ml of the protein mixture at an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:100 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by addition of an equal amount of trypsin and incubation overnight. Generated peptides were collected by centrifugation. Five-hundred microliters of 50 mm TEAB were added to the retentate and incubated, followed by isolation of peptides by centrifugation. The step was repeated and the collected samples were unified, lyophilized, and dissolved with 500 mm TEAB in a final volume of 200 μl. Two-milligrams of peptides were obtained from 170 mg of plant material as determined by UV (Nanodrop, Peqlab ND1000).
Protein Precipitation from SDS-Containing Plant Cell Lysates (Wessel-Fluegge)
One-milliliters of plant lysate was mixed with 4 ml of methanol (LC-MS Chromasolv, Fluka) and 1 ml of CHCl3 (Chromasolv Plus, Sigma-Aldrich). Three-milliliters of H2O were added and mixed again. The sample was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min. The upper phase was removed and 4 ml methanol was added. The sample was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed by two consecutive steps of suspension in methanol followed by centrifugation. The pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 250 μl 8 m urea and 50 mm TEAB, which was supported by sonication. Protein concentration was determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) to be 7.25 μg/μl. Then 140 μl of the solvent containing 1 mg protein mixture were incubated with 14 μl of 50 mm TCEP for 60 min at 30 °C, followed by alkylation with 7 μl of 200 mm MMTS for 30 min at room temperature. The sample was diluted with 50 mm TEAB to a concentration of 6 m urea, supplemented to 2 mm MgCl2 (Fluka) and 2 mm CaCl2 (Fluka) and treated with six units Turbo DNase (2 U/μl), Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA and 800 units Benzonase (250 U/μl, purity grade I, Merck) for 30 min at 30 °C. Lys-C (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Osaka, Japan) was added in a ratio of 1:50. After 2 h of incubation at 30 °C, the sample was diluted to 2 m urea and the DNA digest was repeated as described above. Trypsin was added in a ratio of 1:80 and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The sample was further diluted to 0.8 m urea and another aliquot of trypsin was added and incubated over night at 37 °C.
iTRAQ Labeling
Each of the four different samples (FASP: 1.8 mg; protein precipitation: 1 mg) were labeled with one of the iTRAQ 4-plex reagents (wild type: iTRAQ 114; wild typeIR: iTRAQ 115; atm atr: iTRAQ 116; atm atrIR: iTRAQ 117) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A complete iTRAQ kit (AB Sciex) was used for each of the two samples. Labeling efficiency was determined by LC-MS/MS analysis of a small aliquot and the four samples were mixed in equimolar amounts. Equimolarity was validated by LC-MS/MS and the sample was freeze-dried. FASP generated samples were purified via reversed phase chromatography. In brief, the sample was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Pierce) and adjusted to a pH below two using 10% TFA. Desalting was performed with Strata-X reversed phase polymeric solid phase extraction cartridges (Phenomenex, 200 mg, Torrance, CA). Peptides were eluted with 70% acetonitrile (ACN, Chromasolv gradient grade, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% formic acid (FA, Suprapur, Merck), followed by freeze-drying. Samples generated by protein precipitation were purified via SCX-chromatography using a PolySULFOETHYL A (poly LC) column (4.6 mm i.d. × 150 mm). Chromatography was performed using a steep gradient with a ternary buffer system. Starting with 100% buffer A (5 mm NaH2PO4 (Sigma), pH 2.7, 15% ACN) for 15 min, ramping to 50% buffer B (5 mm NaH2PO4, pH 2.7, 1 m NaCl (Merck), 15% ACN) and 50% buffer C (5 mm Na2HPO4 (Merck),pH 6, 15% ACN) in 5 min, followed by isocratic elution at 50% buffer B and 50% buffer C for 30 min. The fractions were freeze-dried, dissolved in 0.1% TFA, and desalted as described above.
Enrichment of Phosphopeptides by IMAC and TiO2 Chromatography
Phosphopeptides were enriched using IMAC by first dissolving the dried peptide mixture in 4 ml of 40% ACN and 0.1% FA. After incubation with 140 μl of IMAC beads (Phos-Select Iron Affinity Gel, P9740, Sigma) for 60 min, the bead suspension was split and transferred to two Mobicol (MoBiTec) spin columns with a 10 μm pore filter at the outlet. The flow-through was collected by centrifugation. Beads were washed 10 times with 400 μl loading buffer and two times with 5% ACN and 0.1% FA. The first two washes were pooled with the flow-through for TiO2 chromatography and freeze-dried. Bound peptides were eluted with four times 100 μl 1 m NH4OH (Merck). The eluates of the two columns were unified and freeze-dried.
For titania enrichment, the dried IMAC flow-through was dissolved in 0.1% TFA, desalted as described above and again freeze-dried. The pellet was dissolved in 3 ml of TiO2 loading buffer (300 mg/ml lactic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 80% ACN, 0.1% TFA) and incubated with 10 mg of TiO2 resin (Titansphere bulk media, 5 micron, GL Science, Tokyo, Japan) for 60 min. The beads were transferred to one Mobicol spin column and the flow-through was collected, freeze-dried and later used for protein quantification.
The TiO2 beads were washed with 8 × 500 μl of TiO2 loading buffer, 8 × 500 μl of 80% ACN, 0.1% TFA, 4 × 500 μl of 1% ACN, 0.1% TFA, 4 × 500 μl of 1% ACN, 0.1% FA. Bound peptides were eluted from the resin by addition of 4 × 100 μl 0.3 m NH4OH and 4 × 100 μl 0.7 m NH4OH, followed by freeze-drying.
SCX Chromatography
Phosphopeptides from IMAC and TiO2 enrichment were separated with SCX after combining both samples. Each of the dried samples was dissolved in 50 μl buffer A, combined and adjusted to pH < 3 with 8.5% H3PO4 (Merck). SCX was performed using an Ultimate system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 25 μl/min and a custom-made PolySULFOETHYL A (poly LC) column (5 μm particles, 300 Å, 1 mm i.d. × 250 mm). The phosphopeptides were separated by a combined salt and pH gradient. For separation, a ternary gradient was used. Starting with 100% buffer A for 10 min, followed by a linear increase to 10% buffer B and 50% buffer C in 80 min, to 25% buffer B and 50% buffer C in 10 min, 50% buffer B and 50% buffer C in 5 min, and an isocratic elution for further 15 min. The flow-through was collected as single fraction, along the shallow part of the gradient fractions were collected every minute, followed by collecting fractions every 2 min. The 94 fractions were stored at −80 °C. Two-hundred micrograms of peptides of the desalted TiO2-flow-through were separated by SCX applying the same gradient as above. Here, the total number of fractions was 98. ACN was removed by vacuum centrifugation and the samples were acidified with 0.1% TFA and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
Samples generated by protein precipitation were separated in a slightly modified form using a steeper gradient. Starting with 100% buffer A for 20 min, followed by a linear increase to 10% buffer B and 50% buffer C in 30 min, to 25% buffer B and 50% buffer C in 10 min, to 50% buffer B and 50% buffer C in 5 min, and isocratic elution for 15 min. The flow-through was collected as one fraction, followed by one 8-min fraction, and then fractions of 2 min were collected. In total, 33 fractions were collected for further analysis.
LC-MS/MS
On-line separation was performed with an Ultimate 3000 dual gradient nano-LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded on a trap column (PepMap C18, 5 mm × 0.3 mm, 5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 25 μl/min. After a desalting step of 15 min, the trap column was switched online with the analytical column (PepMap C18, 250 mm × 0.075 mm, 3 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using solvent A (5% ACN, 0.1% FA). Peptides generated by the FASP protocol were eluted at a flow rate of 275 nl/min applying a linear gradient from 0 to 100% B (30% ACN, 0.08% FA) in 60 min, followed by a step to 85% B and 15% C (80% ACN, 10% trifluoroethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.08% FA) in 1 min, and another steep gradient to 10% B and 90% C in 4 min. For the analysis of peptides generated from the protein mixture isolated by precipitation, a 90 min dual gradient (from 0–100% B) was used.
Data-dependent MS/MS was performed using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer, equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the analysis of phosphopeptides, the MS survey scan was acquired in the Orbitrap, recording a window between 350 m/z and 2000 m/z at a resolution of 60,000. The target value was 1,000,000 using a maximal fill time of 400 ms. Monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled and ion clusters with a charge higher than one were analyzed via MS/MS. Using a combined collision induced dissociation (CID)- higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) approach, the five most prominent ions were analyzed by MS/MS via CID using multistage activation in the LTQ using a target value of 10,000 and a maximal fill time of 200 ms. A normalized collision energy of 35%, a Q-value of 0.25 and an activation time of 10 ms was used. Each precursor was additionally fragmented via HCD and analyzed in the Orbitrap, using an isolation window of 1.6 m/z, a resolution of 7500, a target value of 100,000, a maximal fill time of 600 ms and a normalized collision energy of 50%. Fragmented ions were put on an exclusion list for 60 s. The lock mass option was enabled using polydimethylcyclosiloxane (m/z 445.12) for recalibration. Samples from the protein precipitation experiments and the TiO2 flow-through were analyzed in a slightly modified MS/MS set-up.
MS/MS Data Interpretation
Raw data were interpreted with Proteome Discoverer (version 1.3.0.339, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) using the search engine Mascot (Version 2.2.07, Matrix Science, UK) against The Arabidopsis thaliana protein database (TAIR10_pep_20101214, 35386 sequences), supplemented with common contaminants and concatenated with a decoy database containing the reversed sequences of the original database. The data sets from all 2D-LC-MS/MS experiments of the IMAC/TiO2-enriched sample were analyzed simultaneously. The mass tolerances were set to 5 ppm for peptide masses, 0.5 Da for CID-generated fragments and to 30 mDa for HCD spectra. Trypsin was defined as proteolytic enzyme, cleaving after lysine or arginine including cleavage before proline and three missed cleavages were allowed. Alkylation of cysteines by MMTS and iTRAQ labels on the peptide N terminus and lysines were set as fixed modification. Phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine, oxidation of methione, acetylation on the protein N termini, and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine were set as variable modifications. The MS/MS data sets from the TiO2-flow-through were searched without allowing phosphorylation.
Peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) were filtered by requiring a minimum peptide length of eight amino acids and a search engine rank of one. Peptide confidence was set to high and proteins were grouped applying strict maximum parsimony principle. An ion score threshold was set separately for HCD and CID scans to reach a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.5% as measured by the target-decoy approach. The required ion scores for the TiO2- enriched sample were 23 for CID and 11 for HCD. For the TiO2-flow-through sample, the required scores were 25 and 10, respectively.
Using Proteome Discoverer, both files were opened in a single multiconsensus report to ensure a joint protein grouping according to the maximum parsimony principle. The list of proteins was sorted by the sum of the protein ion scores, calculated by the sum of the highest scoring PSM for each unique peptide. The protein list was filtered by a FDR of 1%. By removing the respective peptides from the data set, the FDR at the PSM level was reduced to 0.05%. For the sample of the protein precipitation experiment only a dataset containing the phosphopeptide-enriched sample was generated. This dataset was filtered to 0.5% FDR for PSMs. The Mascot ion score threshold was set to 23 for CID spectra and to 13 for HCD spectra.
Phosphorylation Site Localization
To localize the phosphorylation sites in the peptides identified in the phosphopeptide-enriched sample, PhosphoRS 2.0 implemented in Proteome Discoverer was applied using a cutoff of 75% for the site probability. In the majority of cases, CID and HCD spectra from the same precursor led to identical PSMs and site localizations. If both spectra resulted in different nonambiguous localizations of the phosphorylation in the phosphopeptide, it was classified as ambiguous. In cases where only one spectrum (HCD or CID) led to a nonambiguous site localization, the localization was considered nonambiguous.
iTRAQ Quantification
To quantify iTRAQ reporter ions, the integration method provided by Proteome Discoverer with a mass window of 5 mDa was used. To account for extreme regulation events, absent iTRAQ reporter ion values were replaced with a value of 100. PSMs with iTRAQ intensities below 1000 in all four channels were removed. The ratios 115/114 (WTIR/WT), 117/116 (atm atrIR/atm atr), 116/114 (atm atr/WT), and 115/117 (WTIR/atm atrIR) were calculated for each quantified PSM.
For the phosphopeptide-enriched sample, the geometric mean and standard deviations of the ratios were calculated for the repeated measurements of each unique phosphopeptide. If no peptide with localized sites was identified for a certain unique phosphopeptide sequence, then repeated measurements of the peptide with nonlocalized sites were used to calculate the geometric mean and the standard deviation.
The ratios of phosphopeptides were normalized by the corresponding protein ratios calculated from at least three quantified PSMs from the TiO2-flow-through LC-MS/MS experiments. For phosphopeptides corresponding to proteins without a sufficient relative quantitation, the original ratios are reported. To perform normalization on the protein level for the sample from the protein precipitation experiment, the nonphosphorylated peptides, which had been co-isolated in the phosphopeptide-enriched sample were used to calculate a protein ratio.
Analysis of Phosphorylation Motifs
To identify sequence motifs significantly enriched in the datasets of up- and down-regulated phosphopeptides relative to the background of all phosphopeptides quantified in this study, we utilized Motif-X. All quantified phosphopeptides (PhosphoRS 2.0 value > 0.75) were centered at their phosphorylated amino acid and ten positions upstream and downstream were used in the analysis (sequence context retrieved from TAIR10). If phosphorylation sites were located at the C- or N- (sub-) termini, the sequences were extended with “X” (X, any amino acid). The sequences were loaded as pre-aligned text data and all motifs were identified with a probability threshold of 1E-06 (Bonferroni corrected p value = 0.0004) and an occurrence threshold of at least three peptides.
Bioinformatic Data Analysis
Potential human orthologs of the 108 direct or indirect candidate targets of the ATM and ATR kinases were derived from the following five orthology databases using default settings: OrthoMCL DB (version V5); InParanoid (version 7.0); HomoloGene (homologene_build 65.data); Roundup (version 2.0); and Oma browser (version from march 2014).
To identify known and predicted protein–protein interactions between the 108 potential ATM and ATR target proteins, the STRING database (version 9.1) was used, applying the following settings: a medium confidence score of 0.4 was set and interactions based on either experimental evidence, curated databases, or by text-mining were scored and displayed.
A Pfam domain search was performed using Pfam 27.0 applying the standard settings
