ABSTRACT:
The focus of the present study was to characterize the phosphoproteome of cytotoxic T cells and to explore the role of the serine threonine kinase PKD2 (Protein Kinase D2) in the phosphorylation networks of this key lymphocyte population. We used Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids in Culture (SILAC) combined with phosphopeptide enrichment and quantitative mass-spectrometry to determine the impact of PKD2 loss on the cytotoxic T cells phosphoproteome. We identified 15,871 phosphorylations on 3505 proteins in cytotoxic T cells. 450 phosphosites on 281 proteins were down-regulated and 300 phosphosites on 196 proteins were up-regulated in PKD2 null cytotoxic T cells. These data give valuable new insights about the protein phosphorylation networks operational in effector T cells and reveal that PKD2 regulates directly and indirectly about 5% of the cytotoxic T-cell phosphoproteome. PKD2 candidate substrates identified in this study include proteins involved in two distinct biological functions: regulation of protein sorting and intracellular vesicle trafficking, and control of chromatin structure, transcription, and translation. In other cell types, PKD substrates include class II histone deacetylases such as HDAC7 and actin regulatory proteins such as Slingshot. The current data show these are not PKD substrates in primary T cells revealing that the functional role of PKD isoforms is different in different cell lineages.
METHODS:
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice, Cell Culture, and SILAC Labeling
P14 T-cell receptor transgenic mice (P14-TCR) PKD2 null mice, and wild-type littermates were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the Wellcome Trust Biocenter at the University of Dundee in compliance with U.K. Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 guidelines as previously describe. P14 CTL were generated and labeled in SILAC media as previously described. Briefly, splenocytes were activated for 2 days with the P14-TCR cognate ligand (peptide gp33–41 from Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus, LCMV). Then, cells were cultured for 4 days in SILAC medium (Dundee Cell Products, Dundee, UK), l-proline 200 mg/l, l-arginine 84 mg/l, pre-supplemented with 300 mg/l l-glutamate, 10% dialyzed FCS with a 10kDa cutoff (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 50 units/ml penicillin-G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 ng/ml IL-2 (Proleukin, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). The following arginine and lysine isotopes were used:   The SILAC labeling was performed in three biological replicates, where the P14 wild-type CTLs cells comprised the “light” condition and PKD2 null CTLs were labeled with “heavy” amino acids in two experiments (experiments 1 and 2), and a label switch was performed in the third experiment (experiment 3).
For the generation of non-TCR transgenic CTLs, splenocytes were activated for 2 days with 0.5 μg/ml of anti-CD3 antibody (2C11, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), followed by 4 days of culture in RPMI (Life Technologies), 10% FCS (Invitrogen), supplemented with penicillin-G, streptomycin, β-mercaptoethanol, and IL-2.
Sample Preparation, Phosphopeptide Enrichment, and Mass Spectrometry
P14 wild-type and PKD2 null CTLs differentially labeled in SILAC media for 4 days were mixed at 1:1 ratio (total 3 × 108 cells) and stimulated for 5 min with P14-TCR cognate peptide (LCMV gp33–41). After TCR stimulation, cells were washed once in cold PBS and were subjected to cytosol and nuclear fractionation as previously described. Briefly, cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 15 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.15% (v/v) Nonidet-P40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g. Cytosolic fractions were removed and nuclear-membrane fractions were resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.05, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm ZnCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton-X100). Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10%, v/v) for 15 min/ice. Protein pellets were resuspended in Urea 8 m Tris-HCl 100 mm. Cytosolic and nuclear lysates were subjected to alkylation with iodoacetamide prior to trypsin digestion (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
Hydrophilic Liquid Interaction Chromatography (HILIC), Immobilized Metal Ion Affinity Chromatography (IMAC), and Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) Affinity Chromatography
Proteolytic digestion products were desalted on a 1-g Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA), and subjected to hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) using a 4.6 × 250-mm TSKgel Amide-80 5-μm particle column (Tosoh Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan). The following buffers were used: HILIC buffer A (0.1% TFA) and HILIC buffer B (99.9% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA). The peptide pellets were resuspended in 80% HILIC buffer B and injected onto the HILIC column. The chromatography was done using the following elution gradient: 80% B held for 20 min followed by 80% B to 60% B in 40 min and finally 0% B for 10 min.
Eighteen fractions of each subcellular compartment were collected throughout the gradient and further enriched in phosphopeptides by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC, Phos-Select, Sigma) following manufacturer's instructions. Peptides were eluted with 200 μl, 0.4 m NH4OH followed with 200 μl, 0.2 m NH4OH/50% acetonitrile. A gel-loading tip was used to remove elution fractions and further remaining IMAC beads were removed by passing fractions through a ZipTip (Millipore). The supernatants from the IMAC (combining the 18 fractions for each subcellular compartment in nine samples) were used for additional TiO2 pull down (Titanspheres, GL Sciences, Shinjuku, Japan).
Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
The peptide mixture was separated by nanoscale C18 reverse-phase liquid chromatography (Ultimate 3000 nLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) coupled online to a Linear Trap Quadrupole (LTQ)-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following buffers were used: HPLC Buffer A (2% acetonitrile and 0.01% formic acid), HPLC Buffer B (90% acetonitrile and 0.08% formic acid) and HPLC Buffer C (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Samples were injected in 1% formic acid, washed onto the column with HPLC Buffer C and eluted with a flow of 0.3 μl/min under usage of the following buffer gradient: 5% B (0–3 min), 5–35% B (3–68 min), 35–90% B (68–70 min), 90% B (70–80 min), 90–5% B (80–81 min), and equilibrated in 5% B (81–100 min). The eluting peptide solution was automatically (online) electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer using a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark). The mass spectrometers were operated in positive ion mode and used in data-dependent acquisition modes. A full scan (FT-MS) was acquired at a target value of 1,000,000 ions with resolution r = 60,000 over a mass range of 335–1800 amu (atomic mass unit). The ten most intense ions were selected for fragmentation in the LTQ Orbitrap Velos. Fragmentation in the LTQ was induced by collision-induced dissociation (CID) with a target value of 10,000 ions. For accurate mass measurement, the “lock mass” function (lock mass = 445.120036 Da) was enabled for MS scan modes. To improve the fragmentation of phosphopeptides, the multistage activation algorithm in the Xcalibur software was enabled for each MS/MS spectrum using the neutral loss values of 48.99, 32.66, and 24.50 m/z units. Former target ions selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 300 s. General mass spectrometric conditions were as follows: spray voltage, 1.0–2.5 kV; no sheath and auxiliary gas flow; ion transfer tube temperature, 150–180 °C; and normalized collision energy (35%) using wide band activation mode for MS2. The isolation width was set to 2 amu for IT-MS/MS. Ion selection thresholds were 600 counts for MS2. An activation of q = 0.25 and activation time of 30 ms were applied in MS2 acquisitions. The fill time for FTMS was set to 1000 ms and for ITMS to 150 ms. In this study, three independent biological replicates of P14 wild-type versus PKD2 knockout CTLs were analyzed, with two technical replicates for each biological sample (total 310 HPLC-MS/MS runs). In two experiments, the wild-type cells comprised the “light” condition, whereas the PKD2 knockout CTLs were labeled with “heavy” amino acids (experiments 1 and 2). In the third experiment, we performed a label switch (experiment 3).
Data Processing
For data analysis, we combined the raw data obtained from the two technical replicates, the two subcellular fractions (nucleus and cytosol), and the IMAC and TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment methods in each independent replicate. Data was processed using MaxQuant version 1.3.0.5 which incorporates the Andromeda search engine. Proteins were mapped to the Uniprot mouse protein database (“Mouse Complete Proteome“ retrieved on August 19, 2013). This version of the database contains 16,618 mouse complete proteome entries (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot canonical and isoform sequence data). Search parameters specified an MS tolerance of 20 ppm, an MS/MS tolerance at 0.5 Da and full trypsin specificity, allowing for up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification and oxidation of methionines, N-terminal protein acetylation, and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine were set as variable modifications. Peptides were required to be at least six amino acids in length with false discovery rates (FDRs) of 0.01 calculated at the level of peptides, proteins, and modification sites based on the number of hits against the reversed sequence database.
To make our data accessible to the scientific community, the MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD001076. The annotated_spectra.zip file contains .pdf files with annotated MS/MS spectra for all PTM containing peptides described in the manuscript. Separate MS/MS spectra for the highest identification and localization scores have been deposited. To facilitate the search for the annotated spectra, an additional excel file (Phospho (STY)Sites_annotated_spectra.xlsx file) containing a list of all reported sites and the file names of their corresponding .pdf files have been deposited. Prior to statistical analysis, the outputs from MaxQuant were filtered to remove known contaminants and reverse sequences. The distribution of SILAC ratios was normalized within MaxQuant at the peptide level so that the median of log2 ratios is zero (supplemental Table S1).
Bioinformatics and Statistical Tools
For functional pathway analysis, the different subsets of proteins identified in the data set were subjected to functional analysis using DAVID bioinformatics resources. Gene ontology terms for biological processes (BP) and molecular functions (MF) charts were obtained using default statistical parameters (threshold: count 2, ease 0.1). Proteins with protein kinase activity and transcription factor activity were filtered based on GOTERM_MF_FAT (GO:0004672 and GO:0003700, respectively).
For the kinase motif distribution, Linear Motif analysis tool in Perseus v1.4.1.3 software was used. Significance of PKD2 motif enrichment was assessed by Chi-square test using Graphpad software (http://www.graphpad.com/).
Western Blotting
Protein expression was assessed using standard Western blotting protocols described elsewhere. Blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Cofilin-Ser3 and anti-Cofilin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), a rabbit polyclonal antisera recognizing HDAC7 (H-273, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or a mouse monoclonal anti-Erk1/2 antibody (3A7, Cell Signaling Technology) as indicated. Horseradish-peroxidase couple anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA.
Retroviral Transduction, Confocal Microscopy, and Flow Cytometry
GFP-HDAC7 retrovirus was produced and P14 wild-type and PKD2 deficient CTLs were transduced as described. Cells were adhered to coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich), then fixed for 30 min at 25 °C with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. A Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope with an alpha Plan-FLUAR 100× objective (numerical aperture, 1.45) was used for confocal microscopy. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were stained as described. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-CD8 (clone 53–6.7), phycoerythrin-anti-CD5 (clone 53–7.3) and allophycocianine-anti-CD25 (clone PC61) were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Data were acquired on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) and were analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR).
