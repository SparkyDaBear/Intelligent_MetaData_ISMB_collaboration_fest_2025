ABSTRACT:
Fbw7 is a ubiquitin-ligase that targets several oncoproteins for proteolysis, but the full range of Fbw7 substrates is not known. Here we show that by performing quantitative proteomics combined with degron motif searches, we effectively screened for a more complete set of Fbw7 targets. We identify 89 putative Fbw7 substrates, including several disease-associated proteins. The transcription factor NF-κB2 (p100/p52) is one of the candidate Fbw7 substrates. We show that Fbw7 interacts with p100 via a conserved degron and that it promotes degradation of p100 in a GSK3β phosphorylation-dependent manner. Fbw7 inactivation increases p100 levels, which in the presence of NF-κB pathway stimuli, leads to increased p52 levels and activity. Accordingly, the apoptotic threshold can be increased by loss of Fbw7 in a p100-dependent manner. In conclusion, Fbw7-mediated destruction of p100 is a regulatory component restricting the response to NF-κB2 pathway stimulation.
Fbw7 is a ubiquitin-ligase, which targets several oncoproteins for proteolysis, and is therefore important for the control and prevention of tumorigenesis. In this study, Arabi and colleagues carry out a proteomic screen of the targets of Fbw7, and identify Nuclear Factor of κ-B2 as a substrate.

Methods
Cell culture and transfections
Human embryonic kidney HEK293 and human osteosarcoma U2OS cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen). Human colorectal carcinoma cell lines HCT116 FBW7+/+ (WT) and HCT116 FBW7−/− (KO) were cultured in McCoy's medium (Invitrogen). All cells were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma) at 40 μM, Cycloheximide (Sigma) at 100 μg ml−1, TNF-α (Prepotech) at 5–10 ng ml−1, GSK3β inhibitor Bromoindirubin (Sigma) at 5 μM for 3 h. Soluble hexa-meric CD40 ligand (ENZO Life Science) was used 0.4 μg ml−1, over night. FBW7 plasmids and transfections were performed as previously described using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) reagent or GeneJuice Transfection Reagent (Novagen). Transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides was performed with HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) for 48 h. Fbw7 siRNA has been described previously. βTrCP siRNA was a kind gift from Dr. Guardavaccaro. Full-length and C-terminal deletion NF-κB2 deletion constructs and NIK vectors were described previously. GSK3β plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Theresa Vincent. The double-point mutant of p100, where serine 707 and serine 711 was replaced by alanines (p100-SA), was generated using the Quickchange kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
Nuclear- and cytosolic-enriched fractions were prepared as described previously. Whole-cell lysate preparation, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting have been described previously. Antibodies: anti-NF-κB2 (Santa Cruz) (2 μg ml−1) and (Sigma) (1 μg ml−1), anti cyclin E (Santa Cruz) 0.4 μg ml−1, anti-HA (Santa Cruz) 1 μg ml−1, anti-β-actin (Sigma) (1:5,000), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) (1:1,000). Antibodies to Bcl-2 (1:1,000), Cyclin D1 (1:1,000), Skp2 (1:1,000) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies to RhoGEF2 (2 μg ml−1), EGFR (0.2 μg ml−1), UBE4B (0.05 μg ml−1), ERN1 (2 μg ml−1), TMF1 (0.5 μg ml−1), SUPT5 H (0.4 μg ml−1), WD12 (0.2 μg ml−1), TEP1 (0.1 μg ml−1), MAP7D3 (1 μg ml−1), UHRF1BP1 (2 μg ml−1), MORC-1 (0.4 μg ml−1), UBAP2 (0.2 μg ml−1) were from Human Protein Atlas antibodies. In-vivo ubiquitination assays were performed essentially as described previously. Briefly, HCT116 (WT and KO) cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-ubiquitin for 24 h and treated with MG132 (50 μM) for 6 h before collectinging and extraction in 1% SDS and 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). Protein extracts were sonicated, diluted ten times in RIPA buffer followed by immunoprecipitation of equal amounts of total NF-κB2 protein using anti-NF-κB2 antibodies.
Pathway analysis
The proteins identified by MS were studied for their biological function and pathways. Basic information about the proteins was retrieved from UniProt/SwissProt database (release 2011-06). These proteins were also analysed using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA version 9, release date 2011-03-12).
Reporter assays and mRNA expression analysis
Luciferase reporter assays were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. κB-responsive gene-specific reporters from the Cyclin D promoter and the Bcl-2 promoter (a kind gift from Professor Neil Perkins) were used. κB- TATA luciferase reporter has been described previously. Renilla was used for normalization. Luciferase reporter experiments were repeated three times. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA by using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) followed by quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR) analysis, as described previously. Gene expression levels were analysed on an ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR System (SDS software version 1.3.1) and normalized, based on GAPDH mRNA expression. Primer sequences are indicated in Supplementary Table S5. For Bcl-2, Quantitate SYBR-validated primers were used (Qiagen). Gene-specific mRNA expression levels were determined by Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 GeneChips, as previously described in ref.. Relations between continuous variables were investigated by means of the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test. A P-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
Sample preparation for Proteomics
Protein extracts of the two subcellular fractions were precipitated by acetone. The resulting pellets were dissolved in 1% SDS, with subsequent stepwise dilutions to 0.1%SDS. After estimation of the total protein amount (Bio-Rad DC), to each aliquot containing 40 μg of total protein, TEAB pH 8.5 was added (25 mM final conc.). After reduction of cysteines by dithiothreitol and carbamidomethylation by IAA, samples were digested by trypsin (sequencing grade modified, Promega). The resulting peptide mixtures were labelled with TMT (Thermo Scientific) and then pooled into the subcellular sets. After sample cleanup by solid phase extraction (SPE strata-X-C, Phenomenex), the two pools were subjected to peptide IEF-IPG (isoelectric focussing by immobilized pH gradient) in the pI range 3.7–4.9 (ref.). From each pool, 72 IEF peptide fractions were eluted by liquid handling robotics (GE Healthcare prototype) into a 96-well plate (V-bottom, Corning product #3894), which was then dried in a SpeedVac.
LC-ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap MS/MS
For each run, the auto sampler (HPLC 1200 system, Agilent Technologies) dispensed 8 μl of solvent A to the well in the 96 V plate, mixed for 10 min, and proceeded to inject 3 μl into a C18 guard desalting column (Agilent) before a 15-cm long C18 picofrit column (100 μm internal diameter, 5 μm bead size, Nikkyo Technos, Tokyo, Japan) installed on to the nano-electrospray ionization source. Solvent A was 97% water, 3% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; and solvent B was 5% water, 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. At a constant flow of 0.4 μl min−1, the curved gradient went from 2%B up to 40%B in 45 min, followed by a steep increase to 100%B in 5 min. Online LC-MS was performed using a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Precursors were isolated with a 2 m/z window. We enabled 'preview mode' for Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) master scans, which proceeded at 30,000 resolution (profile mode). Data-dependent MS/MS (centroid mode) followed in two stages: first, the top five ions from the master scan were selected for collision-induced dissociation (CID, at 35% energy) with ion trap mass spectrometry (ITMS) detection; and after, the same five ions underwent higher energy collision dissociation (HCD, at 45% energy) with detection in the orbitrap (FTMS). The entire duty cycle lasted ~3.5 s. Dynamic exclusion was used with 90-s duration.
Proteomics data analysis
The MS raw files were searched with a target-decoy approach using Mascot 2.3. (Matrix Science) followed by Percolator 1.17 (build date 2010-10-30) under the software platform Proteome Discoverer 1.3.0.339 (Thermo) against the human SwissProt Fasta protein database (http://www.uniprot.org, release 2011-07). We used a precursor ion mass tolerance of 10 p.p.m., and product ion mass tolerances of 0.02 Da for HCD-FTMS and 0.8 Da for CID-ITMS. The algorithm considered tryptic peptides with at the most one missed cleavage, oxidation (M) as variable modification, and carbamidomethylation (C) and TMT6plex (K, N-term) as fixed modifications. Generated protein and PSM (peptide spectrum match) lists had a 1% false discovery rate (peptide level) cut off. Proteins identified by a single peptide are supplied together with their respective PSMs in Supplementary Data 2 and 3. TMT reporter ion raw intensities from PSMs corresponding to unique peptides (that is, peptides whose sequence match a unique protein) were subjected to the program PQPQ using a correlation P-value of 0.4. The curated quantitative cross-channel ratios for each protein were logged (base 2) and subsequently analysed with SAM (significance analysis of microarrays, response type: two-class unpaired). Lists of up- and down-regulated proteins were thus obtained with a cutoff at SAM q-value 2%. The proteomics data have been deposited in the PRIDE partner repository Proteome Exchange (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) with the dataset identifier PXD000005. Raw and search result files are available via ftp at ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/2012/06/PXD000005/ or alternatively via SweStore at https://webdav.swegrid.se/snic/bils/ki_scilife/pub/nc.arabi_etal_2012.pdf
Bioinformatics and motif analysis
The canonical human subset of Swiss-Prot was downloaded from http://www.uniprot.org on 28 October 2011 and searched for non-overlapping matches to regular expressions corresponding to the motif definitions. Netphos 3.1b was used to predict phosphorylation sites for GSK3 and other kinases in the human protein set. The protein lists produced by the proteomics data analysis were mapped onto the canonical subset of proteins by truncation of the protein identifier for non-canonical isoforms and each protein was assigned the smallest q-value as determined by SAM of any variety detected by PQPQ. SciPy and NumPy (http://www.scipy.org) were used for statistical calculations and plots produced by Matplotlib (http://www.matplotlib.sf.net). Quantification of immunoblot band intensities was performed using Fiji/ImageJ.
mRNA expression correlation analysis
Relations between continuous variables were investigated by means of the bivariate, two-tailed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test. A P-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. PASW statistics 17 statistical package was used.
