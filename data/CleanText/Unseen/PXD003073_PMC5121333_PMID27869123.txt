ABSTRACT:
Amino acids (aa) are not only building blocks for proteins, but also signalling molecules, with the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) acting as a key mediator. However, little is known about whether aa, independently of mTORC1, activate other kinases of the mTOR signalling network. To delineate aa-stimulated mTOR network dynamics, we here combine a computational–experimental approach with text mining-enhanced quantitative proteomics. We report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are acutely activated by aa-readdition in an mTORC1-independent manner. AMPK activation by aa is mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ). In response, AMPK impinges on the autophagy regulators Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) and c-Jun. AMPK is widely recognized as an mTORC1 antagonist that is activated by starvation. We find that aa acutely activate AMPK concurrently with mTOR. We show that AMPK under aa sufficiency acts to sustain autophagy. This may be required to maintain protein homoeostasis and deliver metabolite intermediates for biosynthetic processes.
 mTORC1 is known to mediate the signalling activity of amino acids. Here, the authors combine modelling with experiments and find that amino acids acutely stimulate mTORC2, IRS/PI3K and AMPK, independently of mTORC1. AMPK activation through CaMKKβ sustains autophagy under non-starvation conditions.

Methods
Cell lines and tissue culture
Experiments were performed in C2C12 myoblasts (obtained from the department of Ralf Baumeister, University of Freiburg, D), HeLa α Kyoto cells (obtained from Cecile Arrieumerlou, University of Basel, CH) and Ulk1/2 DKO MEF cells (kindly provided by Tullia Lindsten, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, USA) overexpressing FLAG-ULK1-WT or FLAG-ULK1-S758E. All cells were tested every 3 months for mycoplasma contamination by performing a PCR on the cell supernatant. For retroviral infection of MEFs, human complementary DNAs encoding either FLAG-tagged full-length ULK1 or an ULK1-S758E mutant were cloned into pMSCVpuro (Clontech Laboratories, Takara Bio, 631461). For the production of recombinant retroviruses, Plat-E cells (kindly provided by Toshio Kitamura, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan) were transfected with 1.9 μg pMSCVpuro-based retroviral vectors using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche, 11988387001). Ulk1/2 DKO MEF cells were incubated with retroviral supernatants containing 9 μg ml−1 Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, H9268-106) and were selected in medium containing 2.5 μg ml−1 puromycin (InvivoGen, ant-pr-1). For inducible knockdown of mSin1, C2C12 cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding the specific shRNA (target sequence: 5′-TAATCCAAAACTTAGTGCT-3′) on the tetracycline-sensitive pTRIPZ vector (clone V3THS_375315) obtained from Dharmacon Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA. C2C12 cells were transduced with lentivirus according to the manufacturer's instructions. Knockdown was induced with 2 μg ml−1 doxycycline (Calbiochem, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 4 days. For knockdown of Raptor, a lentiviral plasmid was obtained from Addgene (pLKO mouse shRNA 2 raptor, #21340, target sequence: 5′-CCGGGCCCGAGTCTGTGAATGTAATCTCGAGATTACATTCACAGACTCGGGCTTTTTG-3′). C2C12 cells were transduced with viral supernatant twice. Cells were collected 4 days after the first transduction.

Analysis of cell lysates
Cells were starved, stimulated and lysed as described previously. In brief, cells were starved for aa and growth factors in HBSS for 16 h before all stimulation experiments. Cells were stimulated with DMEM containing aa and supplemented with 100 nM insulin (I1882, Sigma Aldrich) or with DMEM only, as indicated. For HBSS+aa stimulation experiments, different aa mixtures were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (catalogue number aa mix 1: R7131 and aa mix 2: M5550) and added 1:50 to HBSS medium. In addition, L-glutamine was added to a final concentration of 3 mM (#25030081, Gibco, Life Technologies). Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with Complete (#11836145001, Roche, Mannheim, Germany), Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (P5726), Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 3 (P0044) (both Sigma Aldrich). Rapamycin (100 nM), wortmannin (100 nM), MK-2206 (1 μM) or STO-609 (10 μg ml−1) were added 30 min before and during the stimulation with DMEM. BafA (100 nM) was added 60 min before and during stimulation with DMEM. Inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and controls were treated with DMSO only.
Pierce enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting substrate (#32209) or SuperSignal West Femto (#34095), both Thermo Scientific Pierce were used to detect chemiluminescence using a LAS-4000 mini camera system (Fujifilm Life Science Systems; Figs 1c, 4b, 5b, 5f and 7b; and Supplementary Figs 2 and 27a) or LAS-4000 mini camera system (GE Healthcare; all other figures). To detect several proteins of different molecular weights on one membrane, the molecular weight of each protein was determined using the protein all blue standard marker (#161-0393, Bio-Rad, California, USA), and membranes were cut accordingly. The uncropped immunoblots for all figures and Supplementary Figures are shown in Supplementary Figs 28–39.
For graphical representation, raw images taken with the Fujifilm camera were exported as colour TIFF files using the Fujifilm software Multi-Gauge version 3.0, Fujifilm Life Science Systems, and further processed with Adobe Photoshop version CS2. For quantitation, the raw images were analysed with Multi-Gauge version 3.0 software (Fujifilm). Local background was subtracted.
Raw images taken with the LAS-4000 mini system were exported as red green blue (RGB) colour TIFF files using ImageJ, and further processed with Adobe Photoshop version CS5.1. Quantitation of raw image files was performed using ImageQuant TL Version 8.1, GE Healthcare. The rolling ball method was used for background subtraction, and the radius was set to 200.
The obtained values were normalized to the control condition and loading control. The mean and the s.e.m. were plotted and statistics calculated as described below.
Mathematical model
The final model including the extended p70-S6K module consisted of 31 species and 48 mass-action reactions and was built using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The species and reactions described the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation protein states of the following modules: IR, IRS, PI3K, Akt, AMPK, TSC1–TSC2, PRAS40, mTORC1, mTORC2 and p70-S6K. The initial protein amount of the unphosphorylated states was fixed a priori to a value that avoided phosphorylation level saturation, whereas the initial amount for the phosphorylated states was fixed to 0. The low basal network activity under starvation is neglected by this simplification. The model was linked to immunoblot experimental data by 12 observable variables (Supplementary Tables 1 and 5) covering all the network. The observable variables used for model parameter estimation and as readouts (model output) throughout the manuscript are indicated with the suffix ‘obs' in the model files. For the species Akt, PRAS40 and p70-S6K, the observables represented the total phosphorylation level of the corresponding phosphosite (for example, Akt-pS473-obs was associated to the sum of the species Akt-pS473 and Akt-pT308-pS473, whereas Akt-pT308-obs was linked to the sum of the species Akt-pT308 and Akt-pT308-pS473). Although this design represented all Akt, PRAS40, and p70-S6K phosphorylation states, its expansion was combinatorial in the number of states, adding complexity to the parameter estimation and identification. Using an approach similar to rule-based modelling, we constrained the parameter values of the corresponding first and second reactions (for example, the parameter Akt-pS473-dephos-first, which regulated the dephosphorylation from the state Akt-pS473 to Akt, was constrained to be equal to the parameter Akt-pS473-dephos-second, which regulated the dephosphorylation from the state Akt-pT308-pS473 to Akt-pT308). This process allowed us to express all the internal states of Akt and PRAS40, but maintained a low number of estimated parameters. A legend of all the names (for example, species, parameters, observables and so on) used in the model is provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 5. A complete list of ODEs is provided in Supplementary Tables 2, 3 and 6.
The Matlab Toolbox PottersWheel and the PottersWheel identifiability toolboxes MOTA and PLE were used for designing and calibrating the kinetic rate constants of the models. Each reaction contained a kinetic rate constant parameter that was estimated within the range (1e−06, 1e+04). The insulin receptor module (three parameters) was independently calibrated by executing two rounds of combined parameter estimation and MOTA identifiability analysis (Supplementary Table 4; Supplementary Fig. 4). Each round consisted in up to 2,500 independent fits with a parameter disturbance noise of 0.4. For each fit a maximum of 250 iterations with χ2 and parameter tolerances of 1e−05 were run using the TrustRegion optimization algorithm. For each round, parameters were considered as non-identifiable when their correlation coefficient of the parameter tuple and the coefficient of variance were >15% and 0.9%, respectively. Since the s.e. of the experimental time points was often large, a 10% error model of observation was adopted solely for the task of parameter estimation. This improved the approximation of the model versus the data. CVODES integrator was selected and configured with the following parameters: maximum number of steps, 1,500; relative tolerance, 1e−06; and absolute tolerance, 1e−08. MOTA was configured with the parameters: percentageBestFits, 50; minimumPValue, 0.001; percentageOutliers, 100; maxNumberOfParameters, 5. Once the IR was calibrated, the networks (from 32 to 35 parameters) for the 69 model variants, including additional aa inputs, were estimated maintaining the previous algorithm configuration. To reduce the computation time of this task, a cluster of six GNU/Linux computers for a total of 60 cores was adopted. For the model including the aa input connections of mTORC1, mTORC2, AMPK and IRS, and the simplified p70-S6K module (Supplementary Tables 1–4), we estimated and identified the parameters by iterating up to eight rounds of alternated parameter estimation and MOTA identifiability analysis (Supplementary Table 4; Supplementary Figs 4–12). Due to the difficulty of measuring PI3K dynamics experimentally, the PI3K module was not associated to any observable data. Therefore, the parameters describing this protein complex were assumed during the calibration of the model, including a simplified p70-S6K module, to limit parameter non-identifiability. We opted to set these parameter values so that the time course profile for PI3K was close to that for IR. This model was then enhanced to incorporate a more accurate design for the p70-S6K module. To limit the computation time and still achieve an accurate solution, we did not estimate the model entirely, but rather used most of the results from the previous computations (IR and eight additional calibration rounds Supplementary Table 4), but estimated all the eight parameters defining the new p70-S6K module and re-estimated the main four parameters affected by the NFL (IRS, PI3K). The estimation of the parameters for PI3K was considered at this stage to further improve the p70-S6K-dependent NFL. As again, we did not need to re-estimate all the parameters the solution space was sufficiently constrained and limited. In fact, the parameters for PI3K were not completely free as would have been the case for the original calibrations of the rounds 1–8, but were indirectly constrained to the dynamics of Akt, IR and IRS, whose parameters were fixed. This approach allowed us to estimate all these 12 parameters within two additional rounds of parameter estimation.
PLE identifiability analysis was performed a posteriori based on the parameter values of this final model. Almost all the parameters were structurally and practically identifiable except for eight parameters labelled as practically non-identifiable (Supplementary Tables 4 and 7). However, we observed that these either involved parts of the network of secondary importance to our study, such as the refractory state of the IR or PRAS40-T246, or phosphatases for which we did not have any measurement, such as the dephosphorylation of Akt-pT308 or TSC2-pT1462. In addition to the final value of each parameter, we also computed the mean and s.d. from the selected round fits, to assess parameter variability in relation to the model and not only to individual parameter perturbation. In conclusion, we provided evidence that all the model components required for determining our predictions are identifiable.
Modelling Tasks
Copasi 4.8.35 (ref.) was used for simulating the inhibition experiments for 10 levels of protein from 10 to 100% (control) for mTORC1, mTORC2, PI3K and AMPK. As the total level of these proteins remains constant across the time course, this was achieved by modifying initial amounts. Simulations were calculated by running a deterministic algorithm (LSODA), which was configured with the following parameters: duration, 120; interval size, 0.1; intervals, 1,200; integrate reduced model, 0; relative tolerance, 1 × 10−6; absolute tolerance, 1 × 10−12; and maximum internal steps, 10,000. PottersWheel was used to export the models in SBML format Level 2 Version 4. CellDesigner 4.3 (ref.) was used to construct the model network topology in systems biology graphical notation (SBGN).
Quantitative SILAC-based phosphoproteomics
Two triple-SILAC approaches were combined to analyse the phosphoproteome of C2C12 cells upon aa stimulation for 0–30 min. Cells were starved for aa for 16 h, before aa readdition. The first approach covered 0, 5 and 30 min aa stimulation. For the second approach 10, 15 and 30 min time points were chosen. Measurements at the 0 min time point (that is, no aa readdition) were used as a reference point for no induction. The fact that the 30 min time point was used for both settings allowed the normalization to this time point and thus a quantitative phosphoproteome analysis across five time points. C2C12 cells were cultivated in SILAC media containing either non-labelled arginine and lysine (light), 13C6-arginine/D4-lysine (medium) or 13C615N4-arginine/13C615N2-lysine (heavy) for at least five passages (1:10), then starved for aa and growth factors for 16 h followed by a stimulation with aa for five different time points. Cells were lysed in sodium deoxycholate lysis buffer and lysates were mixed 1:1:1 followed by tryptic digestion using a trypsin-to-protein ratio of 1:50 at 37 °C for 6 h. In total, five experiments were performed with label switches between the various time points to avoid bias toward a particular label. Zero and 5 min time points included three biological replicates, 10 and 15 min included two biological replicates, while the time point 30 min was included in all experiments and served as normalization. The experimental design of the proteomics study is outlined in the legend sheet of Supplementary Data 1 and 2. The distribution of the SILAC ratios for the data sets acquired at 5, 10 and 15 min of aa stimulation is presented in Supplementary Fig. 24a. The SILAC ratio distribution was highly similar across all three time points, as only a small fraction of all measured phosphosites changed in abundance, whereas the central part remained constant.
Strong cation exchange chromatography and titanium dioxide enrichment were essentially performed as described. In brief, 30 fractions a 2.1 ml were collected throughout the strong cation exchange chromatography gradient. A measure of 20 μl of each fraction were directly used for liquid chromatography/MS analysis, while the major part of the fractions was subjected to titanium dioxide enrichment. All samples were desalted as described. Liquid chromatography/MS analysis was performed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) either coupled to an Agilent 1200 or an Eksigent 2D nanoflow-high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with in-house packed C18 columns of about 20 cm length (Reprosil-Pur 120 C-18-AQ, 3 μm, Dr Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) and no pre-column was used. Peptides were separated using a binary solvent system consisting of buffer A (0.5% acetic acid) and buffer B (0.5% acetic acid and 80% acetonitrile). Samples were loaded in 2% buffer B with a flow rate of 500 nl min−1 and separated by a gradient from 2 to 35% buffer B in 100 min, followed by a gradient from 35 to 80% in 20 min with a flow rate of 250 nl min−1.
Mass spectrometric measurements were performed in the data-dependent mode. The spray voltage was 2.3 kV with no sheath or auxiliary gas flow. The ion-transfer tube temperature was set to 200 °C. MS spectra in the range of m/z 350–2,000 were acquired using an automatic gain control of 1 × 106. The five most abundant multiply charged peptides were selected for fragmentation in the linear ion trap using 35% collision energy and an automatic gain control of 5,000. Multistage activation was enabled with a list for neutral losses of one, two and three phosphoric acid masses. Dynamic exclusion of previously selected m/z values was enabled with a duration of 45 s and an isolation width of 2.
Raw MS files were processed using MaxQuant 1.3.0.0 (refs) and the UniProt mouse protein sequence database (2013.10, containing 51,219 protein sequences). Parameters of MaxQuant processing and raw and processed files were uploaded to ProteomeXchange (identifier: PXD003073).
The MaxQuant protein and modified peptide identification summary was obtained from the ‘modificationSpecificPeptides.txt' MaxQuant output file, and the quantitative phosphorylation sites data from the 'Phospho(STY)Sites.txt‘ file, which have been uploaded to ProteomeXchange (see Data availability). MaxQuant output files are provided in Supplementary Data 4. These data were processed with a custom Matlab script that was submitted together with the raw and processed files to ProteomeXChange. The significantly regulated phospho(STY)sites and phosphopeptides resulting from the Matlab processing are presented in Supplementary Data 1 and 2, respectively. In brief, the Matlab script calculated all possible ratios between 5, 10 and 15 min as nominator and 0 min as denominator leading to nine and six ratios for time points of 5, 10 and 15 min, respectively, using the intensity columns of the three label variants according to the experimental design (see experimental design description in Supplementary Data 1and 2). All log2 ratios were corrected with the log2 ratios median and the entries with at least two existing or non-zero ratios were selected for Volcano filtering. The fold change and one sample t-test with null hypothesis that log2 fold ratio is 0 were calculated for the filtered data for Volcano plot visualization. Filtering of the data was performed with threshold of 1.5 and 2 for fold change and t-test P-value of 0.05 without correction for multiple testing. In data obtained by MaxQuant, we assumed that phosphosites with a probability >0.75 are correctly localized.
Text mining
Supplementary Data 1 (phosphosites) and 2 (phosphopeptides) list the twofold-regulated phosphoproteins for which known molecular links (termed ‘molecular events') with AMPK were sought. Molecular events comprise protein production and breakdown, localization, binding as well as positive and negative regulatory events as defined in the BioNLP Shared Task 2011 on Event Extraction. To mine the scientific literature in an automated manner, Medline as well as the open access subset of PMC were linguistically preprocessed. As of December 2015, Medline comprised 24 million abstract entries and the open access subset of PMC 1 million full-text entries.
The tools utilized for linguistic preprocessing were taken from the JCore repository, and comprise segmentation of text into basic units (sentences and words), acronym recognition and grammatical analysis required for subsequent text mining tools (for example, part of speech tagging). Next, a semantic analysis to correctly identify the occurrence of genes and proteins in texts, as well as molecular events between those was carried out. The identification of gene and protein name occurrences, as well as the assignment of an appropriate UniProt identifier was accomplished by the GeNo tool. Using UniProt IDs for each identified gene or protein name ensured the unique and canonical identification of the referenced entity and thus served as a disambiguation facility. This normalization step was necessary, because the same name may be used to denote a set of distinct genes or proteins. Before conducting the analysis for events, the Medline and PMC databases were filtered to allow for efficient computability. The filtering was done by identifying those Medline abstracts that contained either an occurrence of AMPK or an item of Supplementary Data 1. The respective PubMed-IDs were mapped to PMC identifiers using the NCBI E-utilities to add available full texts to the set of relevant documents. This ensured the identification of relevant events even in the absence of one event partner in the respective abstract. Identifying any event between genes and proteins was finally accomplished by employing the BioSem tool.
Given the BioSem-based reported event set, items that expressed an event between AMPK and an element of Supplementary Data 1 were filtered. To achieve this, the initial 204 distinct UniProt IDs delivered by the FASTA entries/Supplementary Data 1 were mapped to their associated gene names by the mapping tool ‘UniProt mapping service' provided at the UniProt website ( http://www.uniprot.org/mapping/). These gene names, in turn, were subsequently mapped to all associated UniProt identifiers for Homo sapiens and Mus musculus proteins. This resulted in an extended list of 2,201 UniProt entries (Supplementary Data 3, text mining input). For AMPK all UniProt IDs referring to one of its subunits were collected (Supplementary Data 3, text mining input).
The final filtering was consequently accomplished by restricting the BioSem-based event set to those, where an AMPK identifier and an identifier of the extended Supplementary Data 1 and 2 were included (Supplementary Data 3).
Statistics
The number of biological replicates for each experiment is indicated in the figure legends or methods section. The statistical and programming language R version 2.15.1 (ref.) was used to calculate the statistics and generate the model perturbation plots, except for Fig. 5i and Supplementary Fig. 23, where GraphPad Prism Version 5.00 was used to display the quantitations. The s.e.m. was chosen to estimate the statistical variability of the measured samples of experimental time course. Statistical significance between control and treatment in laboratory experimental quantifications was detected by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test implemented in R. Model goodness of fit was computed using AIC as implemented in PottersWheel. Finally, R was also used for the graphic representation of the identifiability matrix computed with PottersWheel plugin MOTA.
