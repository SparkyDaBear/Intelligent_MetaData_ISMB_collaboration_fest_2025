ABSTRACT:
Glycosylation inhibition can improve the efficacy of antitumor drugs and enhance the apoptosis of cancer cells, thus holding great potential for cancer treatment. Inhibition of N-glycosylation induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), and eventually triggers ER stress-related apoptosis. Unfortunately, the detailed timeline of these cell responses and protein expression alterations related to N-glycosylation inhibition is not explicit yet, and the pathways involved in different stages of N-glycosylation inhibition still need to be characterized. In this study, the dynamic proteome alterations related to N-glycosylation inhibition were investigated by further analyzing our previously published quantitative proteomics data from tunicamycin (TM)-treated ovarian carcinoma (OVCAR-3) cells. The results revealed that N-glycosylation inhibition not only directly affects the expression of glycosylated proteins but also alters an extended scale of proteins. Functional annotation of these altered proteins demonstrated that proteins related to ER stress start changing within 6 h, followed by UPR within 24 h, and eventually ER stress-related apoptosis is triggered after 48 h, indicating the conversion of cellular response from positive to negative. The dynamic proteome data presented here provide important information for better understanding of the significance of N-glycosylation to cell survival and TM-related cancer treatment.

MS data
The mass spectrometry-based proteome data of OVCAR-3 cells with or without TM treatment were downloaded from the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) using the dataset identifier PXD001571 (SunS_ll_OVCAR3_TMtreated_Triplicates_Global iTRAQ 8plex_Fl-F24, and SunS_12_OVCAR3_TMtreated_SixTime Points_Global_iTRAQ8plex_Fl-F24) and the data of glycosylated proteins were obtained from Supporting Information (Table S5) in our previous publication. The details about the cell culture and treatment, sample preparation and mass spectrometric analysis can be found in our previous study, The methods are also briefly described below.
Two quantitative proteome datasets for dynamic analysis
In this study, two previously generated proteomic datasets were re-analyzed to monitor the dynamics of protein changes in TM-treated cells. In the first MS dataset (Dataset 1), the OVCAR-3 cells were treated with 1 μm TM and harvested at six different time points (0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h). The total proteins were then extracted from these samples, digested into peptides followed by 8-plex iTRAQ labeling (Fig. 1A). After pooling different labeled samples, the combined sample was fractionated into 24 fractions prior to 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis. The quantified MS data were then used for dynamic analysis of the proteome changes in TM-treated OVCAR-3 cells. In Dataset 2, the cells were treated with 1 μm TM for 48 h in triplicate. Each sample (one untreated and three TM-treated samples) was then separated into two aliquots and labeled by 8-plex iTRAQ reagents prior to 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1B). Dataset 2 was mainly used for the validation of the quantification results of Dataset 1.
Cell culture and N-linked glycosylation inhibition
OVCAR-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS to 50% confluence prior to treatment in triplicate with 1 μm TM for 48 h to inhibit N-glycosylation. The OVCAR-3 cells were also treated with 1 μm TM in triplicate and collected at six different time points (0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h). After removing the medium, the cells were washed five times with phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then lysed directly with 8 M urea/1 m NH4HCO3 solution. Lysates were briefly sonicated until the solutions became clear. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA).
Protein digestion
Proteins from control and TM-treated OVCAR-3 cells were denatured in 8 M urea/1 m NH4HCO3 buffer, reduced by 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine at 37 °C for 1 h and alkylated by 15 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The solutions were diluted 5-fold with deionized water. Then sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA; protein: enzyme, 50: 1, w/w) was added to the samples and incubated at 37 °C overnight with shaking. Samples were centrifuged at 13 000 g for 10 min to remove any particulate matter and purified by a C18 solid phase extraction. Peptides were eluted from the C18 column in 60% acetonitrile/0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid and the peptide concentrations were measured by BCA reagent.
iTRAQ labeling
Equal amounts of tryptic peptides from TM-treated cells with different time points (dynamic set), as well as from control and triplicate TM-treated OVCAR-3 cells (validation set) were labeled by 8-plex iTRAQ reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocols for protein quantification (dynamic set: 0 h TM treatment: iTRAQ 113 and 119; 6 h treatment: iTRAQ 114; 12 h treatment: iTRAQ 115; 24 h treatment: iTRAQ 116; 48 h treatment: iTRAQ 117 and 121; 72 h treatment: iTRAQ 118; validation set: control: iTRAQ 113 and 117; no. 1 treated cells: iTRAQ 114 and 118; no. 2 treated cells: iTRAQ 115 and 119; no. 3 treated cells: iTRAQ 116 and 121). The iTRAQ-labeled samples were pooled and purified by SCX and Cl8 columns for further analysis.
Peptide fractionation using high-pH reversedphase liquid chromatography
All iTRAQ-labeled peptide samples were injected via a 1220 Series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) into a Zorbax Extend-C18 analytical column containing 1.8 μm particles at a flow rate of 0.2 mL•min−1. The mobile-phase A consisted of 10 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) and B consisted of 10 mM ammonium formate and 90% acetonitrile (pH 10). Sample separation was accomplished using the following linear gradient: 0–2% B, 10 min; 2–8% B, 5 min; 8–35% B, 85 min; 35–95% B, 5 min; 95% B, 15 min. Peptides were detected at 215 nm and 96 fractions were collected along with the LC separation in a time-based mode from 16 to 112 min. The 96 fractions of each sample were concatenated into 24 fractions by combining fractions 1, 25, 49, 73; 2, 26, 50, 74, etc. The samples were then dried in a speed vacuum and stored at −80 °C until LC-MS/MS analysis.
LC-MS/MS analysis
Each fraction underwent one LC-MS/MS run on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Peptides were separated on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano system with a 75 μm × 15 cm Acclaim PepMapl00 separating column protected by a 2 cm guard column (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mobile phase flow rate was 300 nL•min−1 and consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid 95% acetonitrile (B). The gradient profile was set as follows: 4–7% B for 5 min, 7–40% B for 90 min, 40–90% B for 5 min, 90% B for 10 min and equilibrated in 4% B for 10 min. MS analysis was performed using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. The spray voltage was set at 2.2 kV. Orbitrap MSI spectra (AGC 1 × 106) were collected from 400 to 1800 m/z at a resolution of 60 K followed by data-dependent HCD MS/MS (resolution 7500, collision energy 33%, activation time 0.1 ms) of the 20 most abundant ions using an isolation width of 2.0 Da. Charge state screening was enabled to reject unassigned and singly charged ions. A dynamic exclusion time of 25 s was used to discriminate against previously selected ions.
Database search
The LC-MS/MS data were searched against reviewed UniProt human protein databases (20226 proteins, downloaded from http://www.imiprot.org on June 30th, 2017) by Sequest in PROTEOME DISCOVER V1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The search parameters were set as follows: up to two missed cleavages were allowed for trypsin digestion, 10 p.p.m. and 0.06 Da mass tolerance were set for precursor and MS/MS ions, respectively; carbamidomethylation (C) and 8-plex iTRAQ (N terminus) was set as static modifications, oxidation (M) and 8-plex iTRAQ (K) were set as dynamic modifications. All results were filtered with a 1% false discovery rate.
GO and KEGG pathway analyses
GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed on differentially expressed proteins in TM-treated samples using the David Functional Annotation Tool (https://david.ndfcrf.gov/home.jsp). The thresholds of count > 2 and P-value < 0.05 were applied as filters on GO analyses, and thresholds of count > 2 and P-value < 1 were applied to show the KEGG pathway involved for the altered proteins.
