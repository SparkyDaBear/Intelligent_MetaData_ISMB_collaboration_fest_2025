# **Metadata Extraction from Mass Spetrometry Proteomics Publications**

## **Problem Statement**  
Reproducibility and data reusability in life-science research hinge on structured experimental metadata. However, most publications embed sample‚Äêto‚Äêparameter relationships in free-text methods and supplemental tables, making large-scale mining arduous. This challenge invites participants to build models or prompts that, given the plain-text of a scientific article, either reconstruct its Sample Data Relation File (SDRF) or at the very least identify the named entities present: a table whose rows represent individual samples and whose columns correspond to annotation classes (e.g., organism, instrument, strain, ect..). An effective solution will accelerate systematic meta-analysis across thousands of publications.

## **Hackathon Overview**  
There are two parts to this hackathon. In the first part you will attempt to reproduce the annotated metadata from a hand curated training set of 107 proteomics publications using any model/pipeline of your choice. In the second part you will apply your model to a set of publications lacking metadata annotations. 

## **Part #1 Train your model**
Build a custom model or pipeline that meets, or surpasses, the performance of the GPT-o4-mini benchmark on gold-standard SDRF annotations.  

- **Core Task**: Automatically identify every text span in a publication that corresponds to metadata annotations, and assign each span to one of our 71 predefined annotation categories.
   - An example of how to apply the latest GPT model available from OpenAI can be found in the [Example use of GPT to annotate publications](#example-use-of-gpt-to-annotate-publications) section of the [Other Technical Information](#other-technical-information) portion at the end of this page.  

- **Bonus Goal**: Go beyond span-level tagging and generate a fully populated SDRF file (tab-delimited format), ready for downstream analysis.

- **Evaluation**: Compute the precision, recall, F1-score for your model results compared to the SDRF. You can test the performance of your model using the interactive python notebooks located [src/data/Performance/](src/data/Performance/).   
   * To test the results of a model/algorithm that outputs a minimal-annotation files use the [src/data/Performance/MinimalAnnotation_Performance_relative2_SDRF.ipynb](src/data/Performance/MinimalAnnotation_Performance_relative2_SDRF.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.  
   * To test the results of a model/algorithm that outputs a full SDRF file use the [src/data/Performance/Predicted-SDRF_Performance_relative2_GS-SDRF.ipynb](src/data/Performance/Predicted-SDRF_Performance_relative2_GS-SDRF.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.  
        
- **Success Metric**: Your solution should match or outperform GPT-o4-mini on a held-out test set of annotated SDRF files.


**Data Provided**  
We have provided the following three key datasets 
1. [The cleaned abstract and methods sections texts from the 100 proteomics publications with gold standard metadata already annotated.](data/CleanText/Training/)  
2. [The Sample Data Relation File (SDRF) containing the gold standard metadata annotations.](data/GoldStandard_SDRFs/) 
3. [A benchmark set of annotations done by the GPT-o4-mini model.](data/BenchmarkAnnotations/o4-mini-2025-04-16/)


## **Part #2 Apply the trained model to unseen data**
Assess how well your trained model generalizes by applying it to completely unseen examples and benchmarking its performance against the training results.

- **Core Tasks**: 
   1. In [BRAT](https://brat.nlplab.org/), manually annotate the Abstract and Methods sections of 10 recently published proteomics papers using our 30-category schema. 
      - For more details about how BRAT works see their [introduction](https://brat.nlplab.org/introduction.html) and [manual](https://brat.nlplab.org/manual.html). 
      - You do not need to install anything and can access the Unseen publications for annotation: [ISMB Collaberation Fest Unseen Annotation Platform](https://somehow-uncle-pit-exploring.trycloudflare.com/index.xhtml#/).
         - Read the tutorial popup and then click "OK".  
         - In the file browser that should be present navigate to ISMB/ and select one of the folders named Unseen_CleanText_Copy#. 
         - Each folder contains the same publications to annotate. 
         - If someone else has already started annotating the publications in a directory please do not over write their annotations and fine a clean directory. 
         - Hover your cursor over the brat logo in the upper right corner untill the login button apears. (Username: ISMB; password: 2025)
         - Once logged in you can annotate each document by highlighting text spans and choosing from one of the [annotation types](data/AnnotatedTypes.txt).  
         - You can download your annotations by hovering over the top left banner until the Data button appears and gives you the option to Export the collection with your annotations.  
   2.  Run your model on these new annotations to generate predicted spans and categories.

- **Bonus Goal**: Use both the [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/)/[proteomexchange](https://www.proteomexchange.org/) with the publication to generate [lesSDRF](https://lessdrf.streamlit.app/) annotation files for the Unseen publications. 

- **Evaluation**: Compute the precision, recall, F1-score for your model results compared to the SDRF. You can test the performance of your model using the interactive python notebooks located [src/data/Performance/](src/data/Performance/).   
   * To test the results of a model/algorithm that outputs a minimal-annotation files use the [src/data/Performance/MinimalAnnotation_Performance_relative2_SDRF.ipynb](src/data/Performance/MinimalAnnotation_Performance_relative2_SDRF.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.  
   * To test the results of a model/algorithm that outputs a full SDRF file use the [src/data/Performance/Predicted-SDRF_Performance_relative2_GS-SDRF.ipynb](src/data/Performance/Predicted-SDRF_Performance_relative2_GS-SDRF.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.  

- **Success Metric**: Your model‚Äôs performance on these unseen papers should match‚Äîor exceed‚Äîits performance on the original training set.

**Data Provided**  
We have provided the following three key datasets 
1. [The cleaned abstract and methods sections texts from 100 PXDs with no SDRF present](data/CleanText/Unseen/)

Note: Most of the sample characteristics and comments above are detailed in this .pdf file but not all. These are an expanded set of annotated tags we use to ensure we get as much metadata from the manuscript as possible and some may not be applicable on a per sample basis (such as NumberBiologicalReplicates).  
  
## Example use of GPT to annotate publications 
### `GPT_Extraction.py` ‚Äî Documentation
This short python script takes in text files and sends them to GPTs latest o4-mini model for annotation with the prompt provided by the user as a text file. You can read detailed documentation and examples below.  

### Overview

This script batch-extracts SDRF-style metadata from plain-text manuscripts using the OpenAI Chat Completions API.
Given a **prompt file** (your extraction instructions) and either a **single `.txt` file** or a **directory of `.txt` files**, it will:

1. Send each manuscript plus your prompt to the model.
2. Save the model‚Äôs response to an output directory named after the model.

---

### Requirements

* Python ‚â• 3.8
* Packages: `openai`, `argparse` (stdlib), `logging` (stdlib), `glob` (stdlib), `numpy` (installed but not used), `os` (stdlib)

Install the OpenAI SDK:

```bash
pip install openai>=1.0.0
```

---
### Authentication
You will need to go to the OpenAI website to set up your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). You should get enough inital tokens to do some training during the hackathon.  

**Do NOT hard-code your API key.**
Set it as an environment variable instead:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."   # Linux/macOS
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."     # Windows PowerShell (restart shell)
```

Then initialize the client with `OpenAI()` (no explicit key) or read from `os.environ`.

---

### Command-Line Usage

```bash
python src/data/GPT_Extraction.py --inpath data/CleanText/Training/PXD000070_PMID24657495_PMC4047622_clean_text.txt --prompt data/prompt/Hari_prompt.txt --outpath tempOutput/
```

#### Arguments

| Flag        | Required | Type | Description                                                                                |
| ----------- | -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--inpath`  | yes      | str  | Path to a **.txt file** or a **directory** containing `.txt` files.                        |
| `--prompt`  | yes      | str  | Path to the prompt file used as the system message to steer extraction.                    |
| `--outpath` | yes      | str  | Root directory where results are written. A subfolder named after `MODEL` will be created. |

---

### Output

For each processed input file `foo.txt`, a result file is written to:

```
{outpath}/{MODEL}/foo.txt_GPTextract.txt
```

The file contains the raw model response (i.e., your extracted SDRF metadata).

---

### Logging & Console Output

* Basic `print` statements announce progress, file paths, and success messages.
---

### Function Reference

#### `CallGPT(text, prompt, client, MODEL) -> str`

**Purpose:** Wraps a Chat Completions call.
**Parameters:**

* `text`: Manuscript content to analyze.
* `prompt`: System prompt guiding the extraction.
* `client`: An instantiated `OpenAI` client.
* `MODEL`: Model name string.

**Returns:** The assistant message content (string).
**Errors:** Catches any exception from the API call, logs it, and returns a string prefixed with `"Error:"`.

---

### Error Handling Notes

* Raises `ValueError` if:

  * The prompt file is missing.
  * `--inpath` is a directory with no `.txt` files.
* API errors are caught and returned as text; you may want to `sys.exit(1)` instead.

---

### Example

```bash
python extract_sdrf_metadata.py \
  --inpath data/manuscripts/ \
  --prompt prompts/sdrf_extraction_prompt.txt \
  --outpath results/
```

Outputs will appear in `results/o4-mini-2025-04-16/`.
